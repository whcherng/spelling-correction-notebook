1. Recombination Every Day: Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi-Cellular Host Infection
As increasing numbers of full-length viral sequences become available, recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently [1,2,3]. Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range [4,5,6,7] or increasing their virulence [8,9], thus accompanying, or perhaps even being at the origin of, major changes during virus adaptation. It remains unclear, however, whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses.
Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co-infect the same host cell. Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms, such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented [10], intra-molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates (in RNA viruses) [11], or homologous or non-homologous recombination (in both RNA and DNA viruses). Quantification of viral recombination in multi-cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches: in vitro (in cell cultures) [12,13,14,15], and in vivo (in live hosts) [16,17,18]. The in vitro approach, which has so far been applied only to animal viruses, allows the establishment of the “intrinsic” recombination rate in experimentally co-infected cells in cell cultures [14,15,19]. However, it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire, living hosts, where the frequency of co-infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population, the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants, and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells. The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in “the real world.”
However, as discussed below, numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination. First, many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection, where only recombinant genomes were viable (e.g., [13,20,21]). Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues [18,22,23,24,25], which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population. So far, no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host. Finally, recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate, rather than the individual recombination rate [1,26,27]. While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account, there are other caveats: isolates have often been collected in different hosts—sometimes in different geographical regions—and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established. Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale.
Taken together, the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi-cellular host infection, although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses. This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) during a single passage in one of its host plants (the turnip Brassica rapa).
CaMV is a pararetrovirus, which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses (e.g., hepatitis B virus), badnaviruses (e.g., banana streak virus), and caulimoviruses (e.g., CaMV). Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non-segmented double-stranded DNA genome. After entering the host cell nucleus, the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome [28] whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II [29]. The CaMV genome consists in approximately 8,000 bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta (Figure 1) [30]. Viral proteins P1 to P6 are expressed from two major transcripts, namely a 19S RNA, encoding P6, and a 35S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P1–P5 [31]. Using the pre-genomic 35S RNA as a matrix, the protein P5 (product of gene V) reverse-transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated [30].
The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times. Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation (i) of a host plant with two infectious or non-infectious parental clones [21,32,33,34,35] or (ii) of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region [36]. While the former revealed inter-genomic viral recombination, the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host's genome. Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and, hence, multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus [37]. Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that, in some cases, CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus, between different viral minichromosomes, presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery [21,35]. Nevertheless, the mechanism of “template switching” during reverse transcription, predominant in all retroviruses, most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses. For this reason, and on the basis of numerous experimental data, CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell, by “legal” template switching between two pre-genomic RNA molecules [21,35,36,38,39], or “illegal” template switching between the 19S and the 35S RNA [36,40]. Under this hypothesis, recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription, with the 5′ and 3′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA (position 0 in Figure 1). The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine. However, since these studies are based on complementation techniques, non-quantitative detection, or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination, they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an “everyday” process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations.
In the present work, we aimed at answering this question. To this end, we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers, demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments. By co-inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild-type and marker-containing CaMV particles, we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants—distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions—have been detected and quantified. Altogether, the recombinant genomes averaged over 50% of the population. Further analysis of these data, assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to 20, indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude, i.e., on the order of a few 10−5, across the entire genome. We thereby provide the first quantification, to our knowledge, of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host.
From Figure 1, and supposing that all marker-containing genomic regions can recombine, we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes: +bcd/a+++, a+cd/+b++, ab+d/++c+, abc+/+++d, ++cd/ab++, a++d/+bc+, and a+c+/+b+d. Indeed, all classes were detected, and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table 1.
Altogether, the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co-infected plants analyzed (Table 1, last column), ranging between 44% (plant 5) to 60% (plants 7, 12, and 20), with a mean frequency (± standard error) of 53.8% ± 2.0%. This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents, to our knowledge, the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi-cellular host.
The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates, assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the 21 d between infection and sampling, are given for each of the ten plants in Table 2. Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large, on the order of 0.05 to 0.1. Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of 4 × 10−5. Interestingly, this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome (Kruskal–Wallis test, p = 0.16).
To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the 21 d, we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or 20 generations. The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear: doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate (detailed results not shown). For example, the average recombination rates r
1, r
2, and r
3 assuming 20 generations were equal to 0.05, 0.04, and 0.025, respectively (compare with values in Table 2), yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of 1.9 × 10−5, 2.2 × 10−5 and 1.6 × 10−5.
Inspection of Table 2 also shows that first-order interference coefficients were in general negative, indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment, while the second-order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance. The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section.
One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed. Indeed, the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi-cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease. Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect, basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non-infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness, on phylogenetically based analyses, or on experiments in cell cultures. For reasons detailed in the Introduction, the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination, but only its occurrence, or address the question at a different temporal, and often spatial, scale. Results from cell cultures, on the other hand, impose cell co-infection by different viral variants, potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events. Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection, and therefore the invasion and co-infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural.
More than half of the genomes (53.8% ± 2.0%; see Table 1) present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants, and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of 2 × 10−5 to 4 × 10−5. The time length of one generation, i.e., the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next, is totally unknown in plant viruses. The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts, where the capsid protein is produced between 48 and 72 h [40]. The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena [30], we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of 2 d and, thus, an average of ten generations during our experiments. In case this estimate is mistaken, we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations, thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established. At this point, we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments. It was previously shown that about 95% of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies [41], where they may be sequestered for a long time, as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells, including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks. The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate. In order to minimize this bias, the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf, where the chances of finding genomes from “unsequestered lines” were assumed to be higher. In any case, our data analysis is conservative, since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate.
Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative: a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci. We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts. Indeed, one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype. In the former, analogous to clonal propagation, recombination is undetectable. In the latter, recombination is not only detectable but, as our results indicate, very frequent. Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events, thus yielding an impression of negative interference. These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models. It is indeed easy to show (detailed results not shown) that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally, analogous to single infections, while the remaining reproduces panmictically, negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist. For example, assuming a three-locus model with real recombination rates r
1 and r
2 and interference i
12, the “apparent” recombination and interference parameters, would be r
1 = (1 − F)r1, r
2 = (1 − F)r
2, and i
12 = −(F − i
12)/(1 − F). Interestingly, this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative: that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate.
As judged by r
1, r
2, and r
3, calculated between markers a–b, b–c, and c–d, respectively, we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome. The values for r
1,
r
2, and r
3 are remarkably similar, hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome. We considered the template-switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV. As already mentioned in the Introduction, hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the 5′ extremities of the 35S and 19S RNAs [21,36,42]. If other recombination mechanisms, such as that associated with second-strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery, act significantly, hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3 [43]. Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers, we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the 5′ end of the 35S RNA and to Δ1 (at nucleotide position 0). Nevertheless, the putative hot spots at the 5′ end of the 19S RNA and at Δ2 and Δ3 (nucleotide positions 4,220 and 1,635, respectively) fall between marker pairs c–d, b–c, and a–b, respectively. Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent—though predicted by different recombination mechanisms—or, more likely, that they simply do not exist. Whatever the explanation, what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome, and thus any gene thereof, with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection.
To our knowledge, the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus [3]. In contrast, retroviruses and particularly HIV-1 have been extensively investigated in that sense. As we have already discussed for these latter cases, the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co-infected cell cultures. The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV-1 is on the order of 10−4 [14,15,19], less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV. Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within-host CaMV recombination rate, we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV.
Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells, including steps of nuclear minichromosome, genomic size RNA synthesis, and reverse transcription and encapsidation. Nevertheless, vertebrate hepadnaviruses (e.g., hepatitis B virus) infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology, and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co-infection during the development of the virus populations. Thus, even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses' shared biological characteristics, they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution.
We used the plasmid pCa37, which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb-S, cloned into the pBR322 plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site [44]. To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome, we introduced four genetic markers: a, b, c, and d, at the positions 881, 3,539, 5,365, and 6,943, respectively, thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double-stranded DNA of 8,024 bp (Figure 1). All markers, each corresponding to a single nucleotide change, were introduced by PCR-directed mutagenesis in pCa37, and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI, PstI, MluI, and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark-S. Because, in this study, we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes, all markers a, b, c, and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I, IV, V, and VI, respectively. Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection, i.e., to create neutral markers. Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations (see below).
To generate the parental virus particles, plasmids pCa37 and pMark-S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described [33]. All plants were turnips (B. rapa cv, “Just Right”) grown under glasshouse conditions at 23 °C with a 16/8 (light/dark) photoperiod. Thirty days post-inoculation, all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier [45].
The resulting preparations of parental viruses, designated Cabb-S and Mark-S, were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al. [46]. We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of 0.5, and a solution containing 0.1 mg/ml of virus particles of both Cabb-S and Mark-S at a 1:1 ratio was prepared. Plantlets were co-infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with 20 μl of this virus solution, using abrasive Celite AFA (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, New York, United States). The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during 21 d of systemic infection.
We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb-S/Mark-S virus population after a single passage in a host plant. Twenty-four individual plants, inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb-S and Mark-S, were harvested 21 d post-inoculation, when symptoms were fully developed. The viral DNA was purified from 200 mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously [47]. After the precipitation step of this protocol, the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean-up kit (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, United States) in TE 1X (100 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA [pH 8]). Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a, b, c, or d and submitted to a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV. Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb-S DNA and twice in Mark-S, thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes. After scanning the agarose gels, we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position, by densitometry using the NIH 1.62 Image program. The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below.
To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations, aliquots from ten of the 24 viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI, and directly cloned into pUC19 at the corresponding site. In each of the ten viral populations analyzed, 50 full-genome-length clones were digested separately by BsiWI, PstI, MluI, and SacI, to test for the presence of marker a, b, c, and d, respectively. In this experiment, with the marker representing an additional restriction site, we could easily distinguish between the Cabb-S and the Mark-S genotype at all four marker positions, upon agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis of the digested clones. Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes, whereas clones harboring 1, 2, or 3 markers were clearly recombinants. Due to the very high number of recombinants detected, markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected.
Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome. Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral, we first discuss assumption.
We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers, both resulting from plants co-infected with a 1:1 ratio of Mark-S and Cabb-S. The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from 24 plants (described above), where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population. The second consisted of the restriction of 50 individual full-genome-length viral clones obtained from one co-infected plant (described above), yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker, and this was repeated on ten different plants. The frequencies of the different markers were 0.508, 0.501, 0.516, and 0.507 for markers a, b, c, and d in the first dataset and 0.521, 0.518, 0.514, and 0.524 in the second dataset. We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality, 0.5, using either t-tests, for datasets where normality could not be rejected (seven out of eight cases), or Wilcoxon signed-rank non-parametric tests otherwise (marker c in the first dataset). In all cases p-values were larger than 0.05.
There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses. First, in all cases we found an excess of markers. Unfortunately, the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because, even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different, the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first. We thus have only four independent estimates in each case, and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size. It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the 1:1 ratio in the infecting mixed solution, or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants. Second, because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power, the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations.
The results clearly show, however, precisely that the markers do not have large effects, if any, and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers. Because of this, along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome, we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis.
The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the 500 full-genome-length viral clones (50 from each of ten co-infected plants) individually genotyped for each of the four markers. As discussed in detail in the Results, recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers. Indeed, approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype. It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data.
Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host. Consequently, we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the 21 d that infection lasted in our experiment (we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection). Based on the kinetics of gene expression [40], we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between 2 and 3 d, and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time. In case this assumption is incorrect, we did calculations assuming five, seven, ten, or 20 replication cycles during these 21 d. As shown, the results were not affected qualitatively, and only slightly quantitatively. It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template-switching mechanism, and that therefore, from a recombination point of view, the CaMV genome is linear. The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position 0 in Figure 1, which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome. This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b, b–c, and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot, as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA, during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b, b–c, or c–d.
To estimate the recombination rate between markers, we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation, assuming random mating and no selection (i.e., the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model). We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters. Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies (we assumed that the two “parental” genotypes, Mark-S and Cabb-S, had equal initial frequencies of 0.5 and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero) and frequencies after n generations (the observed frequencies; as stated above we used different values of n). All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica.
The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci, e.g., r
1 for the recombination rate between markers a and b, and the interference coefficients, e.g., i
12 for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c. To define these parameters we followed Christiansen [48], and in particular the recombination distributions for two, three, and four loci (respectively, Tables 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 of [48]). It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters, the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered. In other words, we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci, or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus, or the complete information to which we have access, the four-marker genotypes. Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients.
It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically. Instead, we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations, given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters. For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies, and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance. In all cases, the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci.

2. Why can't I visit? The ethics of visitation restrictions – lessons learned from SARS
The sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in April 2003 caused much concern and reaction. Refereed medical journals ever since have been rife with articles about SARS. The eventual containment and treatment of SARS has seen a diminution of the massive media publicity and overt public concern. However, fears have recently surfaced about the potential for re-emergence of SARS in the near future. As we confront the potential need to return to more stringent infection control measures once again, this is an appropriate time to reflect on the ethical values that underlay the strict visitation restrictions imposed in hospitals in Ontario during the SARS outbreak and the moderate restrictions in place since SARS. This reflection will facilitate future decision making with respect to visitation restrictions.
Our infectious disease colleagues are adamant that restricting the movement of people into and around the hospital setting are effective clinical and epidemiological strategies that will help protect both the vulnerable patient population and health care providers themselves, who need to stay healthy so that they may care for their patients. One might argue, then, that visitation restrictions are both enhancing and supportive of public health protection. This position recognizes that there are times when public health protection overrides the protection of individual freedom. It could be argued that visitation restrictions, in light of a potential outbreak of a contagious disease, are ethically sound because of the compelling need to protect public health.
However, even when public health concerns trump individual liberties, the ethical operationalization of this value would demand that 'those whose rights are being infringed' need to be managed in 'an ethical and even-handed manner so that they are not unfairly or disproportionately harmed by such measures' [1].
This is an important and far-reaching consideration because SARS caused collateral damage and we know that the implementation of visitation restrictions will have an impact on a broad range of individuals. Understandably, those patients who were confirmed or suspected of being carriers of contagious pathogens were easily and directly identified. However, there were people who had not demonstrated any risk or epidemiological link to a contagious disease but who experienced quarantine, restriction of movement, inconvenience, loss of pay, and inability to access important and sometimes vital services within the health care system. In fact, there was a general trend within the populace toward avoiding meetings/gatherings, as well as kissing, hugging and even hand shaking. Clearly, these restrictions are reflective of a loss of civil liberties in the general population and render expressions of caring difficult at a time when people may need them the most.
In a health care institution, visitation restrictions not only affect inpatients but also have an impact on ambulatory patients who must come for diagnostic tests or interventions and who, if deprived access, might develop urgent or emergent conditions. Restrictions are likely to cause distress, anxiety and increased complaints. In fact, on review of the University Health Network corporate complaint database, SARS 1 (period March 28–April 20, 2003) and SARS 2 (period May 12–August 10, 2003) generated a 27% increase in complaints over the expected number of complaints for that time period. Specifically, during this time period there would normally have been 770 calls of complaint, but with SARS 1 and 2 a total of 1052 calls of complaint were received. It should be stressed that these data are over and above the complaints received at each site of the corporation, which were not captured in the database. Ultimately, this is a set of problems that must be managed with sensitivity and clarity (Nyhof-Young and colleagues, unpublished data).
In view of the magnitude of implications of visitor restriction, it is important that policy decisions, at the micro or macro level, consider issues of equity, publicity, transparency and the appeal process. Issues of equity must take into consideration the known facts from a scientific perspective as well as the range of approaches considered. In terms of transparency and due diligence, the rationale behind the policies and how they will be implemented should be as clear and unambiguous as possible. Feedback should be sought from those individuals who would be affected by visitation restrictions, such as staff, patients and family members. The policy must be made accessible, printed and broadly circulated throughout the hospital so that people understand the rules, the rationale for those rules, the processes available to them to assist them in 'living with those rules' and ways to appeal in special circumstances.
Visitation policy developers must realize that there may be exceptional circumstances that demand exceptional latitude. The development of criteria for exceptionality must recognize the need for proportionality, ensuring that criteria are 'relevant, legitimate and necessary ... and should be applied without discrimination' [1]. Furthermore, to be consistent with expectations of transparency, the criteria by which exceptionality to the rules of visitation restriction exists should also be published openly throughout the organization for staff, patients and visitors. From our experience with SARS, a corporate policy was developed and there was an expectation that there would be compliance with this corporate policy. However, it was also acknowledged that local patient needs would dictate more or less stringent adherence to these rules, and that the degree of adherence might change quickly without the opportunity for broad notification. For example, although current policy allows for specific times of visitation and numbers of visitors per day, a sudden outbreak might dictate a quick lockdown of the facility without patients or family members receiving prior notice.
A health care professional has a duty to care, based on several ethical considerations [1] such as professional code of conduct, intrinsic requirements of the work and the acceptance of risk as part of the decision to do a specific type of work. Part of this duty to care for patients encompasses a broader duty, in that one must care for their family as well. Visitation restrictions impede this ability because health care providers find themselves in the awkward position of conveying very private, personal messages between patients and family members, of providing updates and of breaking bad news over the phone, thus losing their ability to convey empathy or judge the amount of support required effectively. Moreover, health care workers, being in direct communication with patients and families, bear the brunt of their anger and frustration regarding any restriction in visitation.
There is an implicit acceptance that reciprocity exists between the hospital organization and the individual staff member [1]. To this end, it is the organization that must accept responsibility for making rules and communicating them broadly to all staff, patients and visitors. Similarly, it is the responsibility of the organization to enforce compliance with these rules; it is not the responsibility of staff, whose primary responsibility is to discharge the duty of care to the patient. The organization also has the responsibility of developing a set of criteria outlining exceptionality and a process to receive, review and adjudicate requests. A process must be developed (together with appropriate resources) so that staff members know who to access for support and are able to do this is in an easy and expeditious manner.
In the interests of the public good, there may be times when information must be shared publicly, thereby impinging on the rights of the individual to privacy and confidentiality. With respect to restricted visitation, an ethical argument could be made that visitation restrictions (or latitude thereof) can be instituted generally, without specifically naming names. Although the vigilant observer might be able to identify a specific person from a changed application of the rule, the organization cannot reasonably be expected to guard against every possible identification, but every effort should be made to protect the individual from easy identification. For example, if a family is allowed to visit a patient whose death is presumed to be imminent (within the next 24 hours), then the patient's identity should be protected by using privacy strategies. Efforts to protect the patient's identity are consistent with the ethical value of 'protection of communities from undue stigmatization' [1].
Given the risks associated with contagious pathogens and the easy mode of transmission globally, it is important that there be consistency in management. The ideal situation would be a consistent global approach to the management of each and every contagious pathogen. The notion of universal management strategies is very sensible (e.g. universal precautions with blood-borne conditions such HIV). However, given the political and economic disparities across the world as well as the lack of knowledge (particularly of newly evolving pathogens), a standardized approach is not possible.
The experience of SARS indicates that some patient populations require a level of vigilance that is more stringent than that required in others. For example, those individuals who reported recent travel to high risk areas, and those who worked in quarantined or contaminated hospitals or who exhibited clear symptoms (e.g. fever, persistent cough) were scrutinized with more vigilance and were in fact treated differently than other visitors, until they were cleared through the screening process. This type of variability in vigilance demands ethical management of differences, and there is a need to guard against overt bias or discrimination creeping into the process.
It is difficult to expect that both standardization of approach and variability in approach can easily coexist, but the operational challenge is to exercise awareness of the ethical values discussed above and the appropriate due diligence in the implementation of processes.
It is ethical to accept that public health protection trumps individual rights to liberal visitation. The rationale for this position must be fully outlined to patients, visitors and staff.
In responding to visitors who may be deprived of visitation, it is ethical to recognize that there may be exceptional circumstances that demand exceptional latitude. A set of criteria outlining exceptionality should be developed, as should a process to receive, review and adjudicate requests. In the interests of equity, an appeal process should be made explicit and transparent to all. This information should be well publicized to staff, patients and visitors in a consistent and sensitive manner. Every reasonable effort should be made to protect the individual patient's identity and their specific health status should exceptionality be considered.
It is ethically the responsibility of the organization to enforce compliance with restricted visitation and a corporate department should be assigned this task.
Although it is recognized that standardization in the application of visitation restrictions is necessary, there is recognition that there may be circumstances that would require deviation from the corporate position.

3. Prospective evaluation of an internet-linked handheld computer critical care knowledge access system
The rate of expansion of medical knowledge is increasing rapidly, and it is frequently difficult for clinicians to keep abreast of important new literature. For example, several recently published randomized controlled trials in critical care have demonstrated mortality benefits [1-5], but uptake of new knowledge into clinical practice is often delayed [6-8]. Improving access to this knowledge base at the point of care may lead to better clinical decision making, which could improve patient outcome, reduce costs and optimize bed utilization [9]. In critical care, rapid access to medical reference information may be particularly important in facilitating timely management decisions and avoiding errors [10].
Computing technology can allow point-of-care access to up-to-date medical reference material [11]. A study evaluating a mobile computerized cart to make evidence available to clinicians in an internal medicine setting [12] demonstrated that evidence-based medicine was more likely to be incorporated into patient care when the computerized system was used. Because of their portability, handheld devices may be more practical tools for disseminating knowledge to the point of care. Despite the popularity of handheld devices in medicine, few studies have evaluated the usefulness of this technology [13]. Before widespread dissemination of this type of technology can be encouraged, its impact must be thoroughly evaluated [14]. In the present study we evaluated whether it would be feasible and effective to provide updateable reference information from a central academic centre to handheld computers used by critical care specialists in community hospitals.
A total of 17 intensivists at four community hospital intensive care units (ICUs) in the Greater Toronto Area participated in the present prospective interventional study.
After training, each physician was equipped with a handheld computing device (Palm M505; Palm Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) loaded with medical reference material pertinent to the critical care physician. This information included a customized critical care information handbook ('Critical Care'), which was previously developed for use by residents and physicians at our centre (Additional file 1). Commercially available medical reference software was also incorporated, namely PEPID ED (PEPID LLC, Skokie, IL, USA) and MedCalc .
The handheld devices were able to receive literature updates on a regular basis, using customized software (IqSync; Infiniq Software, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), which accessed an internet-based server using either a connection via desktop computer or infrared data transfer to a telephone modem (Fig. 1). New information was sent to the handheld devices and appeared in a file called 'What's New'. These updates, provided every 2–3 weeks, comprised brief reviews of relevant new literature including a short summary, a commentary and the article abstract.
All handheld devices were equipped with backup software that allowed the content to be rapidly restored in the event of a hardware failure (BackupBuddy VFS; Blue Nomad Software, Redwood City, CA, USA). The devices were also equipped with software capable of generating a log of the applications used (AppUsage; Benc Software Production, Slavonski Brod, Croatia).
Between September and November 2002 the handheld devices were distributed to participating physicians, at which time they each received a 1-hour training session on the use of the handheld device and the internet link (Fig. 2). After training, the participants were able to utilize the devices in clinical practice for 12 months. We provided 24-hour support by telephone and e-mail, with a website for independent review.
Feasibility of the system was assessed by tracking physicians' use of the handheld device and tracking their access of the individual handheld applications during the study period. Physicians who updated their handheld computers at least once a month for 6 months were identified as 'regular users'. A qualitative assessment of the system was achieved through surveys and focus group methodology. Participants completed surveys at baseline to identify their prior familiarity with handheld devices, and at the end of the study period to evaluate subjectively the handheld reference system and the individual handheld applications. Survey data were scored on a 7-point scale, in which 'poor' scored 1 and 'excellent' scored 7. An independent company (The NRC+Picker Group, Markham, Canada) conducted the focus group evaluations at the end of the intervention period, to determine the perceived utility of the information system. Each hospital physician group participated in one focus group meeting.
Information sources that physicians accessed to make clinical decisions were evaluated during simulated patient care scenarios, completed in the physicians' own ICU utilizing a computerized patient simulator (SimMan; Laerdal Medical Corporation, Wappingers Falls, NY, USA). Each physician completed one scenario before the handheld device was introduced (baseline scenario) and one at the end of the intervention period (final scenario), when the handheld device could be used (Fig. 2). A small pool of five scenarios with equivalent complexity was developed, such that physicians would likely need to access information sources in order to make management decisions. The scenarios involved unusual but important conditions, namely thyroid storm, myasthenia gravis, methanol toxicity, malaria and methemoglobinaemia. They were allocated to study participants in such a way as to avoid participants from the same site receiving the same scenario at the same time point, and to avoid repetition of scenarios among individual participants. Each scenario concluded with the physician writing admission orders for the simulated patient.
During the scenarios we tracked all medical reference sources utilized by the physicians, who were encouraged to use a 'think aloud' process [15]. An audiovisual recording was made of the scenarios for later analysis, and when the handheld was used real-time screen capture was incorporated into the recording (Additional file 2). This allowed us to document which handheld applications were accessed, the time taken to access information and the time taken to complete the scenario. We developed an objective scoring system for the admission orders generated at each scenario. The admission orders were assigned a score (range 0–100) by a critical care physician (SM) and critical care pharmacist (LB), who were blinded as to whether the physician used the handheld device. The scenario-specific scoring system allocated points for all necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, weighted according to relative importance. Negative points were given for potentially harmful orders.
Data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR), and permutation tests were used for comparisons because numbers were small and not normally distributed. The differences between the final and baseline admission order scores and the time to completion of scenarios were calculated for each participant. A two-sample permutation test was used to compare these differences between the group of physicians who chose to use the handheld in the final scenario and those who did not use the device. Admission order scores obtained for each of the five scenarios were compared. Outcomes were considered statistically significant at α < 0.05. The SAS System for Window version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses.
Focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim and subsequently analyzed. Themes were identified and unique perspectives on key issues noted [16].
The handheld information system functioned well during the study period. Tracking of the deployment of handhelds identified 10 regular users (59%), four physicians (23%) who used the system variably and three physicians (18%) who never used their handheld device. The regular users accessed the personal information management applications more commonly (median 32.8 times/month, IQR 28.3–126.8) than the medical software (median 9/month, IQR 3.7–13.7; P = 0.028), although significant variation was noted (Table 1).
Baseline survey data identified that, of the 17 critical care physicians participating, 12 (71%) had previous experience with handheld devices (nine had used the Palm operating system, and three had used Windows CE) for a median duration of 1 year (range 1 month to 3.8 years). Seven participants (41%) reported using handhelds for accessing medical information before the study. Of the 16 final survey respondents, seven (44%) felt that the handheld system had had a positive impact on their clinical practice. The handheld medical applications (Critical Care, What's New, Medcalc and PEPID) received similar ratings, with overall evaluation scores ranging from 4.1 to 5.3 on the 7-point scale.
Four focus group meetings, involving a total of 13 participants (76%), identified the benefits and barriers to use of handhelds for information access, and made suggestions for improvement (Table 2). The overall impression of participants was that there is a role for handhelds for mobile information access, but that in situations away from the bedside other electronic media such as desktop computers were preferable.
Not all study physicians were able to participate in the simulated clinical scenarios on the pre-assigned day. Fourteen physicians (82.3%) participated in the baseline scenarios and 13 (76.5%) in the final scenarios. Information sources utilized during the baseline scenarios included the internet (50% of participants; e.g. Medline searches and electronic textbooks), textbooks (43%), telephoning colleagues, the ICU pharmacist or Poison Control Centre (71%), and other sources such as pocket guides (21%). In the final scenarios, the handheld device was used as the primary source of information by eight participants (62%; Table 3). Of 14 information searches on the handheld device, 11 searches (79%) were successful and the median time to access information was 19 s (IQR 15–40 s). The information sources of those participants not using the handheld device were similar to those in the baseline surveys (Table 3). Analysis of the time to completion of the clinical scenarios demonstrated no significant difference between those physicians who used the handheld and those who did not (12.92 min, IQR 10.73–16.62 min versus 15.5 min, IQR 12.85–22.72 min, respectively).
Physicians who did not use their handheld device in the final clinical scenarios had similar scores to their baseline scenario scores (median 60.0, IQR 40.0–60.0 versus 58.0, IQR 44.5–70.5, respectively). In contrast, an improvement in the final scenario score as compared with the baseline score was noted for those participants who chose to use the handheld device (median 66.0, IQR 52.5–74.5 versus 44.8, IQR 30.5–54.5, respectively; P = 0.018; Fig. 3). When scores recorded for each of the five clinical scenarios were compared, no significant difference was noted, reducing the likelihood that scenario assignment influenced outcomes.
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an electronic knowledge translation system to provide high quality, regularly updated medical reference information from a central academic centre to multiple peripheral users. User acceptance of this technology was not uniform, with just over half of the participants using their handheld devices to access information on a regular basis. Nevertheless, the availability of point-of-care access to information may have improved the quality of clinical decision-making.
Although mobile computing devices have potential beneficial roles to play in clinical medicine, few publications describe formal evaluation of this technology [13]. Because the present study was an early hypothesis-generating evaluation of this technology, multiple quantitative and qualitative outcomes were measured. We generated novel data on the use of handheld devices in a clinical situation, but the study has several limitations. The number of physicians involved was relatively small, with a significant proportion not utilizing the technology. The allocation of clinical scenarios was not randomized, because they were allocated predominantly to avoid using the same scenario at the same site and time point. However, the analysis performed compared participants who used the handheld with those who did not; because it was not known which participant would use the handheld at the time of allocation of scenarios, potential bias was minimized. Furthermore, the scenarios appeared to be equivalent in difficulty because no difference was noted when scores for the individual scenarios were compared. A confounding factor in the study was the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) from March to May 2003, which had a significant impact on the study ICUs [17]. Participants were advised to avoid using their handhelds during patient contact because of the potential to transmit infection, and this affected continuity of the study. Had we not encountered this event, utilization might have been higher.
The lack of universal acceptance of this technology is not surprising and may be due to a number of factors, including inadequate training and the lack of familiarity with the technology [18]. Training is essential when introducing handheld computing technology [19,20] and, although all users underwent a training programme, the surveys and focus groups indicated a need for improvement. Familiarity with handhelds is increasing, with 33% of all Canadian physicians and 53% of under 35-year-olds using these devices in 2003, but these levels of utilization remain relatively low when compared with use of the internet, at 88% [21]. Increasing familiarity with the technology will probably increase acceptance of such a system. Other potential barriers to use of the handheld system may be addressed by the rapidly developing technology, including improved screen resolution, ease of data entry and wireless connectivity. Acceptance may be increased through the development of an all-in-one package on the handheld, allowing additional functionality such as decision support, billing, electronic prescribing and communication.
The study demonstrated the potential role of an updateable handheld information system for knowledge translation in critical care. Rapid access to current clinical guidelines may be a valuable component of a comprehensive solution to reducing error and improving efficiency. Information access may be most beneficial in areas without full-time critical care physicians, particularly given the current imbalance between demand and supply with critical care physicians, which is expected to worsen [9,10]. Recent recommendations highlight the importance of leveraging information technology to standardize practice and promote efficiency in critical care [10]. Handheld information access alone is unlikely to change clinical practice, but it should be considered a component of an electronic knowledge translation system. In many situations other media, such as desktop or tablet computers, may be preferable for information access.
Although the study was carried out in a critical care environment, such a system is probably applicable to other specialties in which clinicians are mobile and may not have ready access to a desktop computer (for example, anaesthesia, emergency medicine, home care). This study provides insight into the potential impact of this technology in improving health care outcomes [14]. Nevertheless, further study that builds on our findings is essential to determine how these new technologies can best be incorporated into the patient care setting.
A handheld computer system is feasible as a means of providing point-of-care access to medical reference material in the ICU. During this study acceptance of this system was variable, and improved training and more advanced technology may be required to overcome some of the barriers we identified. In clinical simulations, use of such a system appeared to improve clinical decision-making.
• 	This study demonstrated that an updateable handheld computer information resource is a feasible means for providing point-of-care access to medical reference information in the ICU.
• 	Acceptance of this system was variable and may be improved by enhanced training and newer technological innovations.
• 	In clinical simulations, this system appeared to improve clinical decision making.

4. Scanning the horizon: emerging hospital-wide technologies and their impact on critical care
This series of articles provides regular surveillance of new technologies which may impact on critical care. Several countries have developed national horizon scanning systems to identify and monitor new health technologies. There is variation in how these centres gather information, but a consistent set of high priority sources has been identified [1]. For the purposes of this article, the outputs of major health technology assessment centres, national regulatory authorities, and recognized scientific news sources (Table 1) were systematically searched for developments relevant to acute and critical care. This was combined with a manual medical literature search, along key editorial themes subjectively selected for this issue.
Point-of-care testing is a major emerging theme throughout the health sector, encompassing both new diagnoses and monitoring of known diseases and their treatment. Areas of research range from the potentially lucrative markets for outpatient, 'office'-based and patient self-testing, through to in-hospital diagnostics, which include both rapid access analysis of traditionally laboratory bound diagnostics and direct patient imaging. Both aspects are particularly relevant to critical care clinicians, who rely on time sensitive diagnosis and treatment in a hyper-acute setting. An example of bedside imaging in cardiac assessment has already been cited in the first article of the present series [2]. Sample analysis, meanwhile, is rapidly developing to encompass bedside biochemical markers, physiological homeostasis monitoring, and novel ultra-rapid forms of infectious disease diagnosis.
B-type natriuretic peptide can be a rapid and effective marker of ventricular strain and heart failure [3], and can now be measured using a point-of-care diagnostic panel (Triage BNP Test; Biosite Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Similar current and forthcoming technologies include rapid access D-dimer assays for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism as part of a structured point-of-care algorithm [4] and unpublished early developments in stroke diagnostics. Validation and clinical trials of these technologies have taken place primarily in the emergency department setting, but heart failure, cerebrovascular accident and pulmonary embolism are all of added significance in the intensive care unit (ICU) as both primary and acquired conditions. Rapid bedside diagnosis of such conditions with minimal need for intrahospital transport may be of great potential benefit to intensivists.
The importance of tight glucose control in sepsis is becoming well established [5], although work continues on refining the target range, with a study of 4,000 patients now in progress (Normoglycaemia in Intensive CarE study, ANZICS, commencing 2004). The first major prospective study of tight glucose control in sepsis introduced a novel algorithm requiring frequent measurements [6], which raised concerns over patient safety and resource utilization in general ICUs. Point-of-care 'stick' glucose testing is already prevalent, but technology now exists for continuous in vivo glucose monitoring, which, although intended for ambulatory use, could improve accuracy in the acute setting. A subcutaneous interstitial glucose sensor system (Continuous Glucose Monitoring System; Medtronic MiniMed, Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) was tested against clamp controlled hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic excursions in volunteers [7]; it was shown to be closely correlated with reference analyzer results (r2 = 0.91; P < 0.001) and highly responsive (half-time 4.0 ± 1.0 min). Similarly, another device (Glucoday; A. Menarini Diagnostics, Florence, Italy), utilizing a 15–100 μl micropump and a biosensor coupled with microdialysis to give a claimed response time of 2 min, will reach European markets this year. Such devices may be incorporated into manual algorithms, or they may potentially open the way to automated closed-loop glucose control.
Microbiological diagnosis within clinical laboratories has been advancing apace [8]. Polymerase chain reaction technology is well established, but progressive refinements have made possible the rapid and near real-time diagnosis of current, novel, or newly relevant pathogens, including HIV and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). Techniques initially aimed at viruses because of their manageable size can now also be applied to bacteria and can be used for broad, simultaneous screening of multiple pathogens (Pneumoplex, Prodesse, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Further refinements in microarrays and microfluidics are anticipated to bring handhand and point-of-care systems into use in the near future.
Point-of-care and rapid laboratory based technologies will soon be able to elicit not only pathogen identity but also patterns of drug resistance. Developments include the use of adenylate kinase assay for accelerated laboratory based identification of drug-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (BacLite, Acolyte Biomedica, Salisbury, UK; ).
Point-of-care testing within emergency and critical care areas is likely to develop rapidly in the next 5 years, but it will bring complications relating to quality control, medicolegal liability, certificated training for ICU and other nonlaboratory staff, increased cost, and territoriality issues.
Finally, other bedside technologies that have recently been assessed include the use of handheld ultrasound devices to detect occult pneumothoraces, which have been shown to have a higher sensitivity than chest radiography (48.8% versus 20.9%) against a computed tomography standard [9]. Preliminary investigations suggest that handheld infrared pupillometry may be of clinical use in detecting midline cerebral shift in head injury patients [10].
More procedure orientated assistance may become available from near-infrared technology, which has been piloted in a computerized bedside visualization device to aid venous cannulation [11]. Applicability to central venous cannulation has not been explored.
Acquired bloodstream infection (BSI) in the ICU is a serious complication. A study of ICU patients in Calgary [12] demonstrated crude death rates of 45% among patients with ICU-acquired BSI, as compared with 21% in those without (P < 0.0001).
S aureus was isolated in 18% of cases in the study cited above. In this context, the development of an antistaphylococcal vaccine (StaphVAX; Nabi Pharmaceuticals, Boca Raton, FL, USA) represents a promising new health technology [13]. StaphVAX is currently in phase III trials for end-stage renal disease, but phase II trials are under way in postoperative and long hospital stay patients.
Health technology assessment encompasses the best use of current health care devices as well as emerging technologies. Medical devices represent a prime infection hazard, and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines [14] cover the safe use of intravascular devices to minimize acquired BSI. However more recent work demonstrates that the incidence of catheter-related BSI may be significantly reduced by adding a further device – needle-free, disinfectable connectors instead of three-way stopcocks – to the existing recommendations (0.7 infections/1000 days versus 5.0 infections/1000 days of catheter use; P < 0.03) [15].
Clinical management of sepsis is normally outside the remit of this section of the journal. However, it is noteworthy that new mechanical technology has been applied to the direct treatment of sepsis rather than to cardiovascular or tissue perfusion monitoring. A recent European multicentre open randomized phase II trial [16] investigated the use of the Endotoxin Adsorber system EN500 (Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) in 145 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock due to suspected Gram-negative infection. The study demonstrated a trend toward reduced ICU stay and more rapid reduction in lipopolysaccharide levels, but it failed to show any difference in outcome.
Certain developments in this sector are pertinent to critical care. ISABEL is a web-based, diagnostic decision support tool intended to provide diagnosis reminders and minimize missed diagnosis of critical disease processes. It is currently in use in several UK and overseas hospitals, with development supported by UK Department of Health funding followed by a commercial launch [17].
The methodology is novel; a commercial artificial intelligence inference engine (Autonomy, Cambridge, UK) is used to extract and structure information from standard paediatric textbooks, and to generate diagnostic reminders from this knowledge base in response to unstructured free text clinical information. The software has been under development for some time and was reviewed in this journal in 2002 [18], but it is now being modified to encompass adult critical illness. A review of decision support systems by the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence is pending.
There are political and medicolegal implications. The ISABEL project was initially set up on a charitable basis by the parents of a child who survived a prolonged stay in paediatric intensive care after a missed diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. Although the system is as yet little known among adult intensivists, its technology is innovative and its proposed status as an 'online second opinion' may give it, together with similar expert systems, a powerful consumerist resonance with patients, carers and managers. The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence findings should be monitored with interest by critical care providers.
More broadly, the UK health service is currently in the grip of a globally unprecedented large-scale National Project for IT (NPfIT) [19]. Structured as a series of private finance initiatives, this ambitious programme will ultimately see in a host of regionally standardized patient information systems, image storage, and networked monitoring and audit systems, linked to a national electronic patient record 'spine'. There are already concerns about timescale, feasibility and funding. Broader concern is growing about catastrophic and unpredictable 'emergent behaviour' in massively interconnected information technology (IT) systems, which are rapidly becoming too complex to test or accurately model [20]. Emergent behaviour in complex systems has already been explored in popular fictional media, in which predicted outcomes are spectacular but somewhat discouraging [21]; however, even without quite such an apocalyptic scenario, we may well see a rising incidence of total system failures due to unpredictable nonlinear behaviour – that is, major collapses triggered by small unforeseen causes. In the light of recent North American power outages and destructive computer failures in the UK social service and tax systems, emergent behavour must now be considered a clear and present threat to our increasingly networked health services and their supporting infrastructure. Levels of concern are such that the UK Government is funding a £10 million research programme into IT complexity and catastrophic failures.
How much of this is relevant to critical care or to other countries? First, ICUs provide complex, time-sensitive care to highly dependent patients. They therefore require the successful convergence of multiple hospital systems, which makes them uniquely vulnerable to the consequences of system failures, whether in diagnostics, supplies, information flow, or indeed electrical power. Second, the currently stated UK NPfIT vision is that all ICU subsystems, including networked monitoring, telemetry and audit systems, will eventually be integrated into NPfIT, with control over equipment selection and data collection handed to the regional private sector consortia and to national audit bodies. Clinician engagement and choice may not feature highly on the agenda, and there are clear concerns over the future of independent research and audit. Finally, clinicians from other countries would be well advised to follow such developments because the UK is not unique in its desire to radically modernize and standardize health IT, starting with a drive toward electronic patient records. In April 2004, President Bush issued an executive order calling for US national implementation of electronic medical records within 10 years, from a current baseline of 19% implementation. In a series of presidential speeches he went on to further define health care objectives substantially similar to the UK NPfIT agenda [22].
Therefore, this represents another area in which political and technological developments outside the ICU may have a direct impact on clinical practice and patient safety, and intensivists are strongly recommended to consult early and engage with those driving their local and national health economy.
A variety of emerging technologies are examined here. Very few of these are designed or marketed to be specific to intensive care, and few are traditional 'devices' that can be physically handled or attached to a patient. However, critical care is a distillation of acute hospital practice, and any health care technology that has an impact on diagnosis, monitoring, and management of acute conditions will be of heightened importance in the clinical pressure cooker of intensive care. Point-of-care testing, accelerated microbiological diagnostics, decision support systems and networked IT systems are all key developments that will exert an impact on future critical care practice.

5. Characterization of the frameshift signal of Edr, a mammalian example of programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting
Programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (hereafter frameshifting for brevity) is a translational control mechanism that allows the production of a specific ratio of gene products from two overlapping open reading frames, the relative quantities of which depend upon the frameshift efficiency at that particular site. Frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein synthesis where, in response to elements in the mRNA, the ribosome switches from the zero reading frame to the −1 frame (in the 5′ direction) at a defined position, and translation continues in the new frame. The frameshift signals of this class, first described in retroviruses (1,2), have subsequently been found (mainly) in other virus genomes and in Escherichia coli insertional elements [reviewed in (3–6)]. The mRNA signals that promote frameshifting comprise a slippery sequence, where the frameshift takes place, and a 3′-stimulatory RNA structure, separated from the slippery sequence by a short spacer region. The heptanucleotide slippery sequence typically contains consecutive homopolymeric triplets (XXXYYYZ), with the ribosome-bound tRNAs decoding the P- and A-site codons slipping from the zero frame (X XXY YYZ) to the −1 frame (XXX YYY). Studies of frameshifting in eukaryotic systems have indicated that X can be any nucleotide, Y is almost always A or U, and Z any nucleotide but G (although the YYZ codon is often AAG in prokaryotic systems). Efficient frameshifting also requires the presence of the 3′-stimulatory RNA beginning ∼5–9 nt downstream of the slippery sequence. At some sites, a simple stem–loop structure appears to be necessary and sufficient for frameshifting but more commonly, an RNA pseudoknot structure is present. These are H-(hairpin)-type pseudoknots (7), although some viral pseudoknots have also been described as kissing hairpins (8,9). The mechanism of frameshifting is not fully understood, although a number of models have been proposed to explain how the interaction of the ribosome with the stimulatory RNA leads to a realignment of the tRNAs decoding the slippery sequence into the −1 frame [(10) and references therein].
Computer-assisted database screens have highlighted the potential for −1 frameshifting in conventional cellular genes (11–13), but only two examples with obvious biological relevance have been identified to date. The first is present in the E.coli dnaX gene, encoding the γ and τ subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The synthesis of the γ protein is by frameshifting, which directs ribosomes to a premature stop codon, while the longest form (τ) is translated by continued standard decoding (14,15). The frameshift occurs at the slippery sequence AAAAAAG, by simultaneous slippage of both P- and A-site tRNALys species from the zero (A AAA AAG) to the −1 frame (AAA AAA) (16,17). This process requires two stimulatory signals in the mRNA, a Shine–Dalgarno-like sequence 10 nt upstream of the slippery sequence and a stem–loop structure 5 nt downstream of it (18,19). The second example, present in the mouse embryonal carcinoma differentiation regulated (Edr) gene, was described more recently (20). Edr and the human orthologue PEG10 [paternally expressed 10 (21)] are single copy genes located on mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 7, respectively. High levels of Edr are seen during mouse embryogenesis, with distinct spatial and temporal patterns of mRNA expression observed in the developing musculo-skeletal system. Edr thus appears to play a crucial role in mammalian development, although its exact function is yet to be determined (20). The normal function of the PEG10 protein is also uncertain, although it is associated with the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (22). The Edr gene has two long, partially overlapping reading frames (RF1 and RF2), with a likely slippery sequence (GGGAAAC) within the overlap region and in the appropriate reading frame. The signal is poorly characterized, but in vitro frameshift assays indicate that ∼30% of ribosomes change frame within the RF1/RF2 overlap region (20). With GGGAAAC as the site of frameshifting, the gene would encode a 37 kDa non-frameshift product (RF1) by normal translation and a 113 kDa fusion protein (RF1–RF2) by frameshifting. RF1 contains a putative zinc-binding domain of the CCHC subclass with a high content of basic amino acids commonly found in retroviral Gag proteins, whereas the protein encoded by RF2 contains a consensus motif for an aspartyl protease catalytic site. Thus, the organization is reminiscent of a retroviral gag/pro overlap and suggests that the Edr frameshift signal is of retroviral origin. Nevertheless, current models of the Edr stimulatory RNA (20) do not resemble closely the kind of structures that have been seen previously at retroviral frameshift signals [reviewed in (23,24)].
As the first eukaryotic cellular example of −1 frameshifting, it is of interest to ascertain whether Edr represents a new class of frameshift signal. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis and RNA structure probing to characterize the Edr signal. We first confirmed the functionality and magnitude of the signal and confirmed a role for the GGGAAAC motif. Subsequently, we derived a model of the Edr stimulatory RNA and assessed its similarity to those stimulatory RNAs found at viral frameshift sites. We found that the structure is an RNA pseudoknot quite different from the one proposed previously (20) but possessing features typical of retroviral frameshifter pseudoknots. From these experiments, we conclude that the Edr signal and by inference, the PEG10 orthologue, do not represent a novel ‘cellular class’ of programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signal, but rather are similar to viral examples, albeit with some interesting features.
Site-specific mutagenesis was carried out by a procedure based on that of Kunkel (25) as described previously (26). Mutants were identified by dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded templates (27). Sequencing through G+C-rich regions was facilitated by replacing dGTP with deaza-GTP in the sequencing mixes.
The Edr frameshift region was amplified from plasmid pSP64T/Edr (20). A 1230 nt region between mRNA positions 631 and 1861 was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and forward and reverse primers, respectively: 5′-TACATGCCATGGGTGCTGCAGCAGCCCCTATC-3′ and 5′-TAGTACAAGCTTCCGGCAGCAGAGTCGGCAGTA-3′. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into plasmid pKT0 (28) to create pKT0/Edr (Figure 1). Plasmid pKT0/Edr/T3 was prepared from pKT0/Edr by inserting the sequence 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGA-3′ at a position 33 nt upstream of the start of the GGGAAAC slippery sequence. This introduced a unique bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase promotor. All plasmid junctions were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded templates rescued from E.coli JM101.
Plasmids for in vitro transcription were prepared using a commercial kit (WizardPlus SV Miniprep; Promega). In vitro transcription reactions employing the bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase were carried out essentially as described by Melton et al. (29) and included the synthetic cap structure 7meGpppG (New England Biolabs) to generate capped mRNA. Product RNA was recovered by a single extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:49:2) followed by precipitation in ethanol in the presence of 5 M ammonium acetate. The RNA pellet was dissolved in water, and the remaining unicorporated nucleotide triphosphates removed by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, dissolved in water and checked for integrity by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. In ribosomal frameshift assays, purified mRNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) as described previously (26). Translation products were analysed on SDS-15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to the standard procedures (30). The relative abundance of non-frameshifted and frameshifted products on the gels was determined by direct measurement of [35S]methionine incorporation using a Packard Instant Imager 2024 and adjusted to take into account the differential methionine content of the products. The frameshift efficiencies quoted are the average of at least three independent measurements which varied by <10%, i.e. a measurement of 30% frameshift efficiency was between 27 and 33%. The calculations of frameshift efficiency take into account the differential methionine content of the various products.
RNAs for secondary structure probing were prepared by in vitro transcription of NdeI-cut pKT0/Edr/T3 using bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase. Transcription reactions were on a 200 μl scale and contained 20 μg plasmid DNA, 2.5 mM of each rNTP and 200 U of T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris, pH 8, 15 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM DTT. After 3 h at 37°C, 100 U of DNase I was added and the incubation continued for a further 30 min. Nucleic acids were harvested by extraction with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and ethanol precipitation. DNA fragments were removed by Sephadex G-50 chromatography and the RNA transcripts concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and its integrity checked by electrophoresis on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.1% SDS. Transcripts (10 μg) were 5′ end-labelled with [γ-33P]ATP using a standard dephosphorylation–rephosphorylation strategy (31), purified from 6% acrylamide–urea gels and dissolved in water. The structure probing experiments followed the general principles outlined by others (32–34). All reactions contained 10–50 000 c.p.m. 5′ end-labelled RNA transcript. RNase probing reactions were carried out in 50 μl reaction volumes containing 50 μg carrier E.coli rRNA (Sigma). Enzymatic probing reactions were carried out on ice for 20 min. RNase CL3 [Industrial Research Laboratories (IRL), New Zealand] and RNase T1 (Ambion) probing was in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7, 2 mM MgCl2 and 0–0.2 units CL3 or T1; RNase V1 (Ambion) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M KCl and 0–0.2 units V1; and RNase U2 (IRL) in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl and 0–0.2 units U2. Enzyme reactions were stopped by the addition of 150 μl ethanol and the RNA recovered by centrifugation. RNAs were prepared for analysis on 6, 10 or 15% polyacrylamide–7 M urea sequencing-type gels [with or without 20% (v/v) formamide] by dissolution in water and mixing with an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer [95% (v/v) formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% bromophenol blue and 0.1% xylene cyanol], before heating at 80°C for 3 min.
Chemical probing was performed with lead acetate and imidazole in 10 μl reaction volumes. Lead probing was at 25°C for 5 min in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM Mg acetate, 50 mM K acetate and 1–5 mM Pb acetate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 33 mM and the RNA recovered by precipitation in ethanol, redissolved in water and prepared for gel loading as above. For imidazole probing, the end-labelled RNA was mixed with 10 μg carrier rRNA, dried in a desiccator and redissolved in 10 μl of 2 M imidazole, pH 7, containing 40 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2. After incubation at 37°C for 2–4 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of a fresh solution of 2% (w/v) lithium perchlorate in acetone. The RNA was recovered by centrifugation, washed with acetone, dried, dissolved in water and prepared for gel loading as above. All structure probing gels included an alkaline hydrolysis ladder as a size marker, prepared by dissolving the dried pellet from 3 μl of end-labelled RNA and 10 μg carrier rRNA in 3 μl of 22.5 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM Na2CO3 and boiling for 2 min. After the addition of an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer and heating to 80°C for 3 min, the sample was loaded immediately onto the gel.
The 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the Edr frameshift signal were not characterized in the previous study (20), but we began our analysis with the assumption that the 5′ boundary is the GGGAAAC heptamer located within the RF1/RF2 overlap region. A 1230 bp portion of the Edr gene containing this slippery sequence and flanked by substantial lengths of open reading frame was cloned by PCR into the expression vector pKT0 (28) (see Materials and Methods) to generate pKT0/Edr (Figure 1). This plasmid contains a bacteriophage SP6 (and T7) promoter for the generation of in vitro transcripts and provides an optimized (Kozak) initiation codon for the translation of the cloned Edr segment. The cloned PCR product was sequenced to confirm that no errors had been introduced into the Edr sequence. To assess crudely the extent to which 3′ sequences were required for frameshifting, a series of run-off transcripts containing varying lengths of Edr sequence were prepared following digestion of the plasmid with NdeI, AvrII, HindIII or BamHI and transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (Figure 1). The mRNAs were translated in the RRL in vitro translation system and the products analysed by SDS/PAGE (Figure 2). Frameshifting was observed in all cases with each mRNA showing an efficiency of ∼30% (hereafter the ‘wild-type’ efficiency) in good agreement with the value obtained by Shigemoto et al. (20). The sizes of the non-frameshifted and frameshifted species were consistent with those expected following frameshifting at the RF1/RF2 overlap region (see legend to Figure 2). As the mRNA from the NdeI-digested plasmid (linearized 105 bp downstream of the slippery sequence) stimulated wild-type levels of frameshifting, subsequent investigations focussed on regions upstream of this restriction site.
To further delineate the essential sequences, in-frame deletions of 24, 63 or 90 nt were introduced into pKT0/Edr in the region between the GGGAAAC motif and the NdeI site (Figure 3A). The plasmids were linearized with HindIII before in vitro transcription and translation. As shown in Figure 3B, efficient frameshifting was observed only with pKT0/Edr/Δ24 nt, hence the stimulatory RNA is in fact longer than that proposed in the original study (20) (Figure 3A, emboldened bases), with a 3′ boundary located between the 5′ edge of the deletions of pKT0/Edr/Δ63 and Δ24. In addition to the non-frameshifted and frameshifted species, an additional longer product was seen in these translation reactions (Figure 3B, asterisk) and in fact, in all translations of pKT0/Edr to a greater or lesser extent. The identity of this product is uncertain. It is unlikely to be an alternative frameshift product, since its size was unaffected by changes in the length of the mRNA downstream of the frameshift site. However, given that its intensity paralleled that of the non-frameshifted product and its size was roughly double that of the non-frameshifted product, it may represent a stable dimer.
The results of the deletion analysis prompted a re-evaluation of the folding possibilities within the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence. Scrutiny of potential base-pairing interactions within this extended region indicated the potential for the formation of an RNA pseudoknot structure, shown in Figure 4B in comparison with the previous models of Shigemoto et al. (20) (Figure 4A). The proposed pseudoknot is positioned ∼5 nt downstream of the GGGAAAC sequence and contains two relatively long stems, linked by loops of three (loop 1) and nine (loop 2) nucleotides. Stem 1 can be subdivided into two regions (1a and 1b) separated by a 3 nt bulge in the second arm.
To test our model of the Edr frameshift signal, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out. The mutants fell into four groups (i) changes in the putative slippery sequence GGGAAAC, (ii) destabilizing and restabilizing mutations within the predicted stem regions 1a, 1b and 2 (iii) a mutation that deleted the bulge triplet between stems 1a and 1b and (iv) a mutation that changed the central seven (of nine) nucleotides in loop 2 to their complementary Watson–Crick bases. Figure 5 shows the mutations (m1–m12) introduced into the frameshift region of pKT0/Edr (Figure 5A), in vitro translations of the mutant constructs (Figure 5B; mRNAs derived from HindIII-cut plasmids) and a summary of the frameshift efficiencies measured for each construct (Figure 5C). As before the sizes of the non-frameshifted and frameshift species expected from these mRNAs were 29 and 45 kDa, respectively.
The two independent mutations created within the putative slippery sequence had the second base of each homopolymeric triplet changed to a C residue (m1 and m2). These changes would reduce the ability of the tRNAs decoding this sequence to slip into the −1 reading frame and consistent with this, each change reduced the frameshifting efficiency (Figure 5). As seen with other frameshift signals, the mutation in the second homopolymeric triplet (GGGACAC, m1), decoded in the ribosomal A-site during the frameshift, was highly inhibitory (frameshifting was essentially abolished), whereas the reduction in efficiency with the P-site change (GCGAAAC, m2) was less dramatic (a 4-fold reduction). These data are entirely consistent with the belief that the GGGAAAC stretch is indeed the site of the frameshift in Edr and confirm the earlier observations of Shigemoto et al. (20).
Analysis of the proposed stem regions involved the introduction of complementary and compensatory changes within stems 1a, 1b and 2. Three mutations were prepared for each stem. Two of these were destabilizing mutations, introduced into each arm of the relevant stem by changing three central base pairs to their complementary Watson–Crick bases. The third was a double mutation leading to a ‘pseudowild-type’ structure, in which both changes were made and should be compensatory. As shown in Figure 5, destabilization of any stem reduced frameshifting efficiency (m3, m4, m6, m7, m9 and m10), but frameshifting was restored in the double mutant, pseudowild-type constructs (m5, m8 and m11) supporting the belief that the stems form and are required for frameshifting. However, there was some stem-specific variation in the magnitude by which frameshifting was reduced by stem destabilization and the extent to which frameshifting was restored in the double mutants. For stem 1a, the reduction in frameshift efficiency after disruption of individual arms was quite modest (∼2.5-fold for the 1st arm; ∼6-fold for the 2nd arm), but frameshifting efficiency was restored to close to that of the wild-type in the double mutant construct (m5, 25.6%). Disruption of stem 1b in the same manner also led to a reduction in frameshifting efficiency, but more dramatically, with frameshifting reduced ∼15-fold for either arm. As with the stem 1a double mutant, frameshift efficiency was restored to close to that of the wild-type value with the stem 1b pseudowild-type construct (m8, 24.6%). Disruption of stem 2 was also inhibitory, with efficiency values of ∼2% for mutations in the individual arms. However, although the double mutant construct showed a rise in efficiency in comparison with the single mutants, frameshifting was restored only to about half that of the wild-type construct (m11, 16.5%).
The presence of the –ACA– bulge in stem 1 was of interest as a triplet bulge has been observed in the frameshift stimulatory RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and shown to contribute to frameshifting, although the bulge is considered to be a component of a stem–loop stimulatory RNA in this system (35). However, we found that deletion of the bulge had a very minor effect on Edr frameshifting, reducing the efficiency by only a few percent (m13, 26.8%).
The final mutation concerned loop 2. In a number of frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots, an adenosine-rich triplex formed between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 has been described and contributes to frameshifting (23,24,36,37). A conserved 5′-AACAA-3′ motif in such loops has its bases rotated by varying degrees to allow interactions with bases on both strands in the minor groove of stem 1. It is an RNA-specific feature, with each interaction involving a hydrogen bond formed from a ribose 2′ hydroxyl group. Loop 2 of the proposed Edr pseudoknot is relatively A-rich (five of nine bases) and includes a 5′-AACGA-3′ stretch. To assess whether loop 2–stem 1 interactions may occur in Edr, the central seven bases of loop 2 were changed to their Watson–Crick complementary nucleotides and frameshifting measured. A modest reduction in frameshifting was observed (m12, 23.2%), but not so dramatic as to suggest a major role for stem 1–loop 2 interactions in this pseudoknot, at least those mediated by runs of loop adenosines, since only one loop 2 adenosine remains in this mutant.
The mutagenesis data provided strong support for our model of the Edr frameshift region, but it was important to confirm the main features by RNA structure mapping. To facilitate this, a bacteriophage T3 promotor was inserted into pKT0/Edr ∼33 nt upstream of the slippery sequence (Figure 1), the plasmid linearized with NdeI and a 130 nt T3 transcript (encompassing the frameshift region) prepared. This was end-labelled with [γ-33P]ATP, gel purified and subjected to chemical and enzymatic digestion before analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Four enzymatic probes were used: RNases CL3, T1 and U2, which preferentially cleave single-stranded C, G and A residues, respectively, and RNase CV1, which targets double-stranded and stacked bases. The chemical probes imidazole and lead acetate were also employed, which show specificity for single-stranded regions. In these experiments, the Mg2+ level was kept at 2 mM, which is the approximate concentration of this ion in RRL (38). Representative structure probing gels are shown in Figure 6 and a summary is shown in Figure 7.
The structure probing data were strongly supportive of the pseudoknot model of Figure 4. The cleavage pattern of imidazole especially was highly consistent with the model, with cleavage occurring only within loops 1 and 2, at the very ends of the stems and in the –ACA– bulge of stem 1. Lead acetate gave a similar cleavage pattern, although there were more cuts at the ends of the stems. Taking all of the probing reagents into account, the pattern of reactivities of stem 2, loop 1 and loop 2 matched the structure prediction very closely. Stem 2 appeared to be very stable in comparison with the same region of other frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots we have studied (39–41). It was cleaved almost exclusively by the double-strand specific RNase CV1, being unreactive with single-stranded enzymatic probes and showing only occasional, weak cleavage with single-stranded chemical probes. The loops also showed appropriate reactivity. Both were cleaved by single-stranded chemical probes and loop 2 also by single-strand-specific enzymes. Only C89 of loop 2 exhibited any consistent cleavage with CV1 and this may indicate some base-stacking. Although loop 1 was not reactive to single-strand-specific enzymatic probes, this probably reflects a reduced accessibility of enzymes to this short loop.
The most unexpected features of this stimulatory RNA were the atypical cleavage pattern of stem 1 and the paucity of cleavages in the slippery sequence/spacer region. The assignment of cleavages in these areas was complicated by a strong compression effect in the gels (see Figure 6A, between bases 40 and 60), presumably arising from stable base-pairing, which was not completely relieved (although much improved) by running reactions on highly denaturing gels containing 20% formamide (Figure 6B). Nevertheless, we were able to assign almost all of the reactivities in this region, and it was noticeable that stem 1, especially stem 1a, showed susceptibility to cleavage by single-strand-specific enzymatic probes, notably RNase T1 at residues G80–82. Similarly, RNase CL3, a C-specific reagent also showed cleavage at some of the C residues in stem 1. Although it can be argued that the the –ACA– bulge in stem 1 would introduce some deformation of the (presumably) A-form helix and increase accessibility of adjacent bases to enzymatic probes, we did not see an increased access of chemical probes, arguing against a severe bulge-induced destabilization of stem 1a. It may be that stem 1a exists in equilibrium with another conformation and one such possibility is shown in Figure 7B. In this alternative model, the first arm of stem 1a is proposed to pair with an upstream region (G35–G40), displacing the second arm of stem 1a and the bulge triplet into loop 2. Some features of this alternative model are attractive, e.g. the cleavage of G80–82 by RNase T1 is rationalized as these residues would be located in loop 2. Similarly, the limited reactivity of the slippery sequence and spacer region to single-strand cleavage reagents could be attributed to the fact that much of the region is folded into a hairpin. However, the alternative model also has flaws, most noticeably that the pattern of reactivities of the bases in the second arm of stem 1a is not fully consistent with their location in loop 2. These bases should show increased sensitivity to lead acetate and imidazole and reduced CV1 cleavage, neither of which was observed. In addition, one might expect that the sensitivity of G80–82 to RNase T1 would be similar to that of the other G's in loop 2 (G86 and G90), which also was not the case.
Based on the mutational analysis (Figure 5) and the chemical probing data, we favour the idea that stem 1a folds according to the original prediction, but shows breathing or flips occasionally into an alternative conformation (perhaps the one described above). This behaviour might account for the fact that destabilization of the stem did not reduce frameshifting as dramatically as those mutations that destabilized stem 1b or stem 2 (Figure 5). Nevertheless, it remains difficult to explain the strong reactivity of the G's (to RNase T1) in the second arm of stem 1a. It may be that unusual structural features are present that promote RNase T1 cleavage. This idea is not without precedent. Structure probing of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot (S. Pennell and I. Brierley, unpublished data), functional derivatives of this pseudoknot (40,41) and a functional derivative of the RSV pseudoknot (39) has also revealed unexpected RNase T1 reactivity towards apparently base-paired G residues, although in these pseudoknots, at the top of stem 2.
In this study, the secondary structure of the Edr frameshift signal was investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and RNA structure probing. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the stimulatory RNA downstream of the slippery sequence folds into an RNA pseudoknot which, although different from an earlier study (20), undoubtedly resembles the frameshift-promoting pseudoknots of virus signals.
The Edr frameshift site comprises a slippery sequence GGGAAAC, a 5 nt spacer region and a relatively large pseudoknot (in viral terms) with 10 bp in stem 1, 9 in stem 2 and loops of 3 (loop1) and 9 (loop 2) nucleotides. In comparison with viral frameshift signals, Edr does not fit into a specific category, but has hallmarks of different viruses. The possession of relatively long pseudoknot stems, especially stem 2, is a feature of the frameshift signals present at the pro/pol overlap of the retroviruses human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) types 1 and 2, simian T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 and bovine leukaemia virus, and also of the coronaviruses, although in these viruses, the pseudoknots are accompanied by the slippery sequence UUUAAAC rather than GGGAAAC (26,42–44). In terms of loop lengths, Edr resembles most closely those pseudoknots found at the gag/pro overlap of the retroviruses Maedi–Visna virus, Mason–Pfizer monkey virus, feline immunodeficiency virus and simian retrovirus (SRV) types 1 and 2, which possess relatively short loops and also employ the slippery sequence GGGAAAC (42). The loops of the Edr pseudoknot are short but sufficiently long to span the stems (7,37). That we have identified the entire frameshift region seems likely from the results of our mutational analysis and from phylogenetic sequence comparisons. In Figure 7A, nucleotides within and surrounding the pseudoknot that differ in the human orthologue, PEG10, are shown. As can be seen, almost all of the sequence variation occurs before the slippery sequence and immediately following stem 2. Four nucleotide differences are present within the frameshift region, but of these, only one is likely to have an effect on pseudoknot function, namely the G to A transition at the top of stem 2. Of the other three changes, one is within the stem 1 bulge and the other two in loop 2. As we have shown experimentally that the bulge in stem 1 is not required for frameshifting and that most of the sequence of loop 2 can be changed without consequence, it seems that these changes are in ‘neutral’ regions. The stem 2 transition itself would only affect the ultimate stem 2 base pair and would likely have only a modest effect on frameshift efficiency. From the perspective of phylogenetics, it will be interesting to see whether Edr orthologues are present in other mammalian species. This will be informative in assessing the conservation of the pseudoknot and the stage in mammalian evolution at which the Edr gene was acquired.
An unexpected feature of the Edr pseudoknot was the marked accessibility of single-strand-specific enzymatic reagents to stem 1a in the structure probing experiments. In the discussion of these data in the Results section above, this accessibility was hypothesized to be a consequence of a relative instability of stem 1a or the presence of a specific stem 1 conformation highly reactive to single-stranded enzymatic probes, such as RNase T1 and CL3. In related investigations of the IBV (40,45), SRV-1 (31) and RSV pseudoknots (39), stem 2, rather than stem 1, proved to be more sensitive to single-stranded probes and possessed unusual susceptibility to RNase T1 (CL3 was not used in these studies). Another difference was highlighted in our mutational analysis of the Edr pseudoknot, where a complementary change that destabilized the first arm of stem 1a still retained about two-fifths of the wild-type frameshifting efficiency (Figure 5, m3 12.2%). In most models of ribosomal frameshifting, a ribosomal pause is proposed to occur upon encounter of the pseudoknot, perhaps because of a failure to unwind the pseudoknot efficiently, and this pause occurs while the decoding centre is over the slippery sequence. In constructs with a stem 1 destabilization, one would expect frameshifting to be greatly reduced, since the ribosome would translate further into the structure (since stem 1 affords less resistance) and fail to pause, or pause at an inappropriate place. Certainly, in the IBV, SRV-1 and RSV pseudoknots (cited above), destabilization of stem 1 has generally proven to be highly inhibitory in comparison with equivalent changes in stem 2. The substantial frameshift efficiency engendered by the m3 mutant may simply indicate the adoption of an alternative (fortuitous) conformation that partially restores stem 1 function. However, it may also highlight a mechanistic aspect of Edr frameshifting, pointing towards a different contribution of the stems to ribosomal pausing and/or a different pathway of unwinding during the frameshift process (23,24). Perhaps in Edr, stem 2, rather than stem 1, is critical in determining the site of pausing or the rate of initial unwinding of the pseudoknot. If this is the case, the stability of stem 1 may be less crucial. Further work is required to ascertain the relative contribution of the two stems to frameshifting in this system. A detailed analysis of related structures (e.g. the HTLV-1 pro/pol frameshift signal) may also prove to be valuable.
Several virus pathogens utilize −1 ribosomal frameshifting, including the retrovirus HIV-1 (46), the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS-CoV (47)] and numerous plant pathogens [for example, see (48,49,50)]. Frameshifting signals have thus been considered as targets for antiviral intervention (51,52). The existence of related signals in eukaryotic cellular genes, however, would potentially complicate the design of, or even prevent the use of such therapies, particularly if the cellular frameshifting signal(s) was structurally similar to the virus examples. The report of frameshifting in the mouse Edr gene provided the first opportunity to characterize such a cellular signal. We have demonstrated here that the Edr signal resembles viral examples closely, with a characteristic slippery sequence—spacer-pseudoknot organization. Thus, the similarity of parts of the Edr coding sequence to the gag/pro region of retroviral genomes extends to the maintenance of a retrovirus-like frameshifting signal. Given this, and the possibility that other retrovirus-like motifs have been subsumed into mammalian genes and retained a role for frameshifting, antiviral agents that target this process may have previously unanticipated consequences on cellular metabolism in uninfected cells.

6. Torsional restraint: a new twist on frameshifting pseudoknots
The structure of an RNA molecule is widely recognized to play a role in many processes, including structurally organizing complex RNAs, the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and in translational recoding and regulation [reviewed in (1)]. One common RNA folding motifs is a pseudoknot, the folding back of a single-stranded RNA onto itself to form two helical structures with single-stranded loops joining them (2). Many such structures can be inferred from RNA sequences and frameshifting function has been demonstrated for some of these [reviewed in (3–5)]. However, though much theoretical progress has been made in understanding how mRNA pseudoknots promote efficient −1 ribosomal frameshifting (6), a complete understanding of this mechanism remains untested.
Programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signals are typically divided into three components. From 5′ to 3′ these are (i) a ‘slippery site’ in the form N NNW WWH, where N must be a stretch of any three identical nucleotides, where W is either three A or U residues, and H is A, C or U (spacing indicates the unshifted zero frame), (ii) a spacer region and (iii) an mRNA structural element, most often a pseudoknot. The general model posits that upon encountering the mRNA pseudoknot, an elongating ribosome is forced to pause such that the anticodons of its A- and P-site tRNAs are base-paired with the zero-frame codons of the slippery site. The nature of the tRNA–mRNA interactions is such that a relative slip of −1 nucleotide still allows base-pairing in the non-wobble positions. The slippage occurs during the ribosomal pause, and it has been shown that changes affecting ribosome pause times affect frameshift efficiencies [reviewed in (7)]. An important observation is that even though mRNA pseudoknots and energetically equivalent stem–loop structures appear to promote ribosome pausing with equal effectiveness, mRNA pseudoknots are more efficient at promoting −1 PRF (8). Our ‘9 Å’ model (6) provided a refinement of the original ‘simultaneous slippage’ (9,10) model of frameshifting by suggesting that rather than the entire ribosome having to slip one base in the 5′ direction, slippage could be accomplished by moving the small section of mRNA in the downstream tunnel by one base in the 3′ direction. We have proposed that this is accomplished by the bulky and difficult to unwind mRNA pseudoknot structures becoming wedged in the downstream entrance tunnel of the ribosome, preventing the downstream region of the mRNA from being pulled into the ribosome by the equivalent of one base during the accommodation step of elongation. This blockage would introduce tension into the spacer region, which could be resolved by unpairing the mRNA from the tRNAs, allowing the mRNA to slip 1 nt backwards, resulting in a net shift of reading frame by −1 base.
Though the 9 Å model provides a partial explanation for why mRNA pseudoknots promote programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) more efficiently than simple stem–loop structures, it does not answer the question of how the mRNA pseudoknot directs the ribosome to pause at the correct position along the mRNA. A complementary ‘torsional restraint’ model addresses this issue (11). When a stem–loop structure is unwound by an elongating ribosome, unwinding of the stem forces the loop to rotate. Since a simple stem–loop is not restrained, the loop can rotate freely and only the base pairs within the stem resist ribosomal movement, and thus the potential energy of unwinding should be distributed along the length of Stem 1 (Figure 1A). However, if the loop is anchored or restrained, as it is in a pseudoknot by Stem 2, since the intrinsic ribosomal helicase is processive (12), Stem 1 cannot be fully unwound until Stem 2 is first denatured. Mechanically, as the ribosome begins to unwind the base of Stem 1, Stem 2 forces the supercoiling in the remainder of Stem 1, providing extra resistance to ribosome movement. At some specific point, the resistance to ribosome movement provided by the supercoiling counteracts the forward movement of the ribosome, increasing the likelihood that the ribosome will stop at a precise point along the mRNA. Energetically, since full unwinding of Stem 1 is dependent on complete denaturation of Stem 2, the potential energy of unwinding of the pseudoknot structure should similarly be directed toward one point. Viewed either mechanically or energetically, this point is where ribosomes will be directed to specifically pause on the mRNA. If it occurs with the tRNAs in ribosomal A- and P-sites positioned at the slippery site, then frameshifting is stimulated. This is summarized in Figure 1B. The efficiency of −1 PRF can thus be viewed as a function of (i) the fraction of ribosomes paused over the slippery site and (ii) the rate at which the structure can be denatured. There is increasing evidence from single molecule experiments that unfolding occurs in quick ‘rips’ at a particular force (13), suggesting that in the case of unfolding pseudoknots, frameshifting efficiency is related to both the energy barriers to unfolding the pseudoknot structure and the resistance of the structure against the force of the ribosome. In the context of the torsional restraint model, this resistance is dependent on the ability of Stem 2 to remain intact while Stem 1 is being unwound.
There is experimental data that indirectly support this model: (i) disruption of the first 3 bp of Stem 1, which would displace the ribosome's pause site to a point 3′ of the slippery site, has been shown to eliminate frameshifting (14); (ii) destabilizing Stem 2, which would allow it to be unwound more readily, has been shown to result in decreased frameshifting efficiency (15–17); (iii) replacing bulges in Stem 1 with base pairs would increase the energy required to unwind the first three bases, and a longer ribosomal pause over the slippery site would follow, yielding increased efficiencies in −1 frameshifting (15,18); (iv) destabilizing the base of Stem 1 by replacing G:C base pairs with A:U pairs decreases −1 frameshifting efficiencies (19,20); (v) the model eliminates the need for a ‘pseudoknot recognizing factor’, the evidence of which has not been forthcoming in either competition assays in in vitro translation systems (21) or by gel retardation assays (J. D. Dinman, unpublished data); and (vi) elimination of a potential torsion-restraining Stem 2, but not of a non-torsion-restraining Stem 2 in HIV-1, resulted in decreased −1 PRF efficiencies (22).
Though all of the cited studies support the torsional restraint model, none has directly addressed it. In the experiments presented in this study, a series of ‘pseudo-pseudoknot’ containing reporter constructs were used to test the torsional restraint hypothesis. In vitro frameshifting assays show that frameshifting can be significantly stimulated by limiting the rotational freedom of the loop region of a stem–loop structure, and that the degree of rotational freedom of Stem 1 is important in determining the extent of −1 PRF. Furthermore, mRNA toeprint analyses reveal a pseudo-pseudoknot-specific strong stop 16 nt 3′ of the slippery site, consistent with this structure being able to direct ribosomes to pause with their A- and P-sites positioned at the slippery site.
All synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were purchased by IDT (Coralville, IA). The modified L-A viral −1 PRF signal containing the G GGU UUA slippery site followed by a simple stem–loop was amplified from pJD18 (23) using the primers luc5′b (5′-CCCCAAGCTTATGACTTCTAGGCAGGGTTTAGG-3′) and luc3′b (5′-CCCCCCATGGGACGTTGTAAAAACGACGGGATC-3′). These were digested with HindIII and NcoI (restriction sites are underlined) and cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pT7-LUC minus 3′-untranslated region-A50 (24). In the resulting reporter construct (pJD214-18), expression of firefly luciferase requires a −1 frameshift, and the 5′ sequence of the Stem 2 is not able to base pair with the 3′ sequence, so that only a stem–loop rather than a pseudoknot is able to form. The same primers were used to amplify DNA from pJDRΨ (23) to make pJD214-Rψ. In this construct, complementary mutations (5′-GCUGGC-3′ to 5′-CGACCG-3′) in the 3′ acceptor sequence of the pseudoknot-forming region of Stem 2 allow the formation of an mRNA pseudoknot that has previously been shown to promote frameshifting at the same frequency as the wild type (23). The primer luc5′CON (5′-CCCCAAGCTTATGACTTCTAGGCAAGGGTTTAGG-3′) contains an additional A nucleotide upstream of the slippery site and was used to make pJD214-0, the zero-frame control. To eliminate the possibility of internal initiation occurring at the luciferase initiation codon downstream of the frameshift signals, the AUG codon was changed to AUA. The Stratagene QuikChange kit was used to mutate pJD214-18 and pJD214-Rψ into pJD336-18 and pJD366-Rψ, respectively, using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGCGTTCTTCTATGGGACGTTGTAAAAACGGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCCGTCGTTTTTACAACGTCCCATAGAAGACGCC-3′ (the mutated codon is underlined). pJD366-18 was further mutated to make a zero-frame control by placing an A upstream of the slippery site using the oligonucleotides 5′-TGACTTCTAGGCAAGGGTTTAGGAGTG and 5′-CACTCCTAAACCCTTGCCTAGAAGTCA (the inserted base is underlined).
A series of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were designed to join the loop acceptor region of mRNA transcribed from pJD366-18 to the downstream region that forms the pseudoknot in the wild-type L-A −1 PRF signal. In the J-oligos, the 3′ sequences base pair with the loop of the mRNA transcribed from pJD366-18, and the 5′ regions of these oligos base pair with the downstream sequence. This orientation is reversed for the R-oligos. These general orientations are shown in Figure 3B. The naming of the oligonucleotide names refers to the number of additional residues placed between the regions of complementarity. The bases complementary to the pJD366-18 sequence are underlined.

Plasmid DNAs were prepared using the Qiagen mini-prep kits and were linearized with DraI in a total volume of 20 μl. Proteins were eliminated by the addition of 2 μl of 1 mg/ml proteinase K and SDS to a final concentration of 0.5% followed by digestion at 50°C for 30 min. Volumes were then increased to 100 μl, extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, and DNA was precipitated with 10 μl NH4Ac and 250 μl ethanol. The purified DNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated H2O. To prepare synthetic mRNAs, 2 μl of purified linear DNAs were used for in vitro transcription using the Ambion T7 mMachine mMessage kit. RNAs were precipitated using 30 μl DEPC H2O and 25 μl LiAc. The RNA was resuspended in 11 μl DEPC H2O (1 μl in 500 would give an OD260 of 0.05–00.1; 1–2 μg/μl).
To anneal the oligonucleotides with the mRNA, J-oligos, R-oligos or the equivalent volumes of dilution buffer alone (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM EDTA final concentration) were added to synthetic mRNA (0.5 μg), and the mixtures were first incubated in a 70°C heating block for 10 min; the block was then removed and allowed to cool to 37°C (30 min), after which they were briefly spun down and incubated on ice. In all experiments, the molar ratios of J- and R-oligos to synthetic mRNAs were 100:1. In experiments using the competing oligonucleotide (C-oligo), this was added to either 0.5:1 or 1:1 molar ratios with either J- or R-oligonucleotides. Reticulocyte lysates were thawed on ice, 15 μl of −met and 15 μl of −leu master mixes plus 20 μl of H2O were added to 400 μl of lysate, and 19 μl of this was added to each annealed reaction to start the in vitro translation reactions. These were incubated at 30°C for 60 min (the reaction reached a plateau after 30–35 min where the greatest difference was seen between the zero-frame controls and the frameshifting plasmids) (data not shown), and the reactions were then placed on ice. An aliquot of 7.5 μl from each in vitro translation reaction was added to 50 μl of the prewarmed luciferase reagent, and luminescence readings were taken after a 3 s delay for 15 s in triplicate using a Turner 20/20 Luminometer.
Synthetic transcripts generated from DraI-digested pJD366-18 (∼1.7 kb) were 5′ end labeled using [γ-32P]CTP. These RNAs (4 μl) were incubated with 1 μl of annealing buffer and either 1 μl of H2O or 1 μl of an oligo (0.25 ng) at 70°C. The heating block was allowed to cool at room temperature for 40 min before 8 μl of RNaseH buffer was added (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT). An aliquot of 1 μl of enzyme was added (mung bean nuclease, RNaseH or RNaseT1) and the reactions incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 4 μl of stop solution, the products separated through a 6% polyacrylamide–urea denaturing gel and visualized by autoradiography.
JD366-18 mRNA (1 μg in 8 μl) was annealed with 2 μl of 3′ end-labeled toeprinting primer (5′-CGTACGTGATCTTCACC-3′, complementary to sequence 240 bp 3′ of the slippery site) as described above. This was added to 15 μl of lysate (200 μl Ambion retic lysate, 7.5 μl of each master mix [−leu and −met] and 70 μl of 250 mM KCl), except for 2 μl, which was added to 15 μl of RT buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (25), 40 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT and 575 μM dNTPs] to be used as a no-ribosome control. In vitro translation reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, which was empirically determined to provide the optimum amount of time to allow ribosomes to initiate translation and pause at the frameshift signal. Subsequently, 15 μl of RT buffer containing RNasin inhibitor and cycloheximide (to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl) was added to stop translation. To this, 2 μl of Superscript II (Invitrogen) was added and the reaction incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by phenol:chloroform extraction and 15 μl of stop solution added. The toeprinting primer was also used in conjunction with pJD366-18 to produce sequencing ladders by standard dideoxynucleotide chain termination methods using Sequenase (USB). Products were separated though 6% polyacrylamide–urea denaturing gels and visualized using a Storm phosphorImager (Pharmacia).
We previously showed in intact yeast cells that the pseudoknot containing mRNA produced from pJDRΨ was able to promote efficient −1 PRF, whereas one in which only a stem–loop can form, transcribed from pJD18, could not (23). As a first step in this study, we tested the ability of synthetic mRNAs produced from pJD366-RΨ and from pJD366-18, two plasmids derived from these parental constructs, to promote −1 PRF. Total luciferase activities produced from these synthetic mRNAs were divided by the luciferase activity produced from the zero-frame control plasmid, pJD366-0, and multiplied by 100% to determine −1 PRF efficiencies. The results show that the trends observed in yeast were replicated in vitro, i.e. JD366-RΨ mRNA promoted ∼8% efficiency of −1 PRF as compared with ∼1.1% promoted by JD366-18 mRNA (Figure 2).
The ‘torsional restraint’ model predicts that conditions that would inhibit the rotational freedom of the loop region of the pJD366-18-derived mRNA should result in enhanced −1 PRF efficiency. The strategy used in this study was to anneal this mRNA with synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to both the loop region and to the sequence downstream that is normally involved in pseudoknot formation. These ‘pseudo-pseudoknots’ would be predicted to restore a pseudoknot-like structure to the mRNA. This is diagrammed in Figure 3A. Two different classes of oligonucleotides having different orientations relative to the mRNA were used to this end: ‘joining’ (J-) and ‘reverse’ (R-) oligos. The orientation of the J-oligos promotes the formation of a structure containing the equivalent of a Loop 2 region, while that of the R-oligos promotes a Loop 1 equivalent. The model also predicts that pseudo-pseudoknots having different degrees of rotational freedom should promote different frequencies of ribosome pausing over the slippery site, resulting in different efficiencies of −1 PRF. In order to control this parameter, increasing numbers of nucleotides were inserted between the mRNA hybridizing regions of the J- and R-oligos. The additional non-complementary bases in the J-oligos are 3′ to the stem–loop residues involved in Stem 2, thus effectively increasing Loop 2. Similarly, the additional non-complementary bases in the R-oligos are 5′ to the loop acceptor residues and correspond to an increased Loop 1. The structure of the stem–loop of pJD366-18 and its maximum base-paired interactions with representative J- and R-oligos are shown in Figure 3B. To demonstrate that an oligonucleotide–mRNA hybrid was capable of forming under the assay conditions, the J1-oligo was incubated with 5′ [32P]labeled JD366-18 mRNA and subjected to RNaseH digestion. Digestion of the RNA–DNA hybrid resulted in a labeled 110 nt fragment, demonstrating that the oligonucleotide bound to the mRNA at the position of the pseudoknot (Figure 4).
Having demonstrated the utility of the in vitro frameshifting assay and that the J- and R-series of oligonucleotides were able to hybridize with synthetic mRNA produced from pJD366-18, the next step was to monitor frameshifting efficiencies promoted by these hybrid species. Significant increases in frameshifting were observed with the incubation of pJD366-18 mRNA with oligonucleotides J1 (∼10%) and J2 (∼35%), while only modest increases were seen with J3 and J4 (Figure 5). These findings are consistent with the notion that changes in the degree of rotational freedom of the structure would affect the distribution of paused ribosomes in the vicinity of the slippery site.
One potential complication with the J-oligos is the possibility that they could interact with the Loop 2–Stem 1 region. In the R-oligos, the additional bases are distal to any possible Loop 2–Stem 1 interactions and would be more analogous to increasing Loop 1. The R-oligos stimulated −1 PRF to an even higher extent than the J-oligos (Figure 5). Importantly, increasing the length of the bridging regions in these oligonucleotides (R1 to R3), which is predicted to increase the rotational freedom of the stem–loop, resulted in decreased frameshifting activity as predicted by the torsional resistance model. However, addition of three residues between the two binding regions of the R-oligo (R4) resulted in an unexpected increase in frameshifting with a very large amount of variation.
In a series of control experiments, 8 nt oligos complementary to the 5′ (Loop 1) and 3′ Stem 2 forming regions of the pseudo-pseudoknot were hybridized to the SL mRNA and −1 PRF assays were performed. Neither of these were able to stimulate −1 PRF, even at concentrations in 100-fold molar excess to the mRNA template (data not shown). Though supportive of our central hypothesis, it is also possible that these results were due to the thermodynamic instability of the RNA:DNA duplexes through the course of the experimental protocol.
To determine whether the stimulation of frameshifting was specifically due to the bridging of the stem–loop with downstream sequence (the pseudo-pseudoknot), as opposed to the nonspecific presence of an RNA:DNA hybrid, the competing oligonucleotide (C-oligo) was designed to form a 15 bp duplex with JD366-18 mRNA, including the 3′ Stem 2 forming region, which was expected to significantly out compete either the J- or R-oligos from binding to this site, thus disrupting formation of the pseudo-pseudoknot (see Figure 3A). Additionally, in the presence of the C-oligo, the J- and R-oligos were still predicted to hybridize with the 5′ Stem 2 forming region, enabling us to address the question of whether this interaction alone was able to stimulate frameshifting. The results demonstrate that the addition of the C-oligo severely inhibited the abilities of both the J- and R-oligos to promote efficient frameshifting (Figure 6). These findings demonstrate that (i) frameshifting was specifically stimulated by bridging of the 5′ and 3′ Stem 2 forming regions by the J- and R-oligos, and (ii) that the presence of an RNA:DNA hybrid at the 5′ Stem 2 forming region was not sufficient to stimulate frameshifting by itself.
The torsional restraint model predicts that pseudoknots should direct elongating ribosomes to pause at one specific location on the mRNA, rather than being distributed along Stem 1. We used mRNA toeprint assays to test this hypothesis. In mRNA toeprint reactions, the movement of reverse transcriptase is blocked by paused ribosomes, resulting in a strong stop positioned ∼16–18 nt 3′ of the P-site of eukaryotic ribosomes (25). Synthetic JD366-18 mRNAs were annealed with the sequencing oligonucleotide and either J1, R1 or no second oligo, and these were then used for in vitro translation reactions. After a period of time (10 min were empirically determined to be optimal), elongation reactions were stopped by the addition of cycloheximide, and reverse transcription reactions were initiated on the sequencing oligonucleotides. In parallel, control reverse transcription reactions were carried out using synthetic JD366-18 mRNA and oligonucleotides, but without in vitro translation. The results are consistent with the model, showing that the J1- and R1-oligos specifically promoted one strong reverse transcriptase stop 16 nt 3′ of the P-site of the slippery site only the in the in vitro translation reactions (Figure 7). As further predicted by the model, a broad distribution of stops of equal intensities was observed in this region with JD366-18 mRNA alone (Figure 7, lane 1). Importantly, the +16 stop was not observed when toeprint reactions were carried in the absence of ribosomes. Additional strong stops were also of interest. One corresponding to the 3′ end of the base of Stem 1 was observed in all samples, consistent with the presence of this structure. Both J- and R-oligo-specific pauses were also observed. The reason for the strong pause in the J-oligo is unknown. The R-oligo-specific pause is perhaps more revealing. It occurs at the 3′ end of the RNA:DNA hybrid formed by this oligo and the mRNA, a structure that should also promote pausing of reverse transcriptase.
The results presented in this study provide strong support for the torsional restraint model of programmed −1 frameshifting. Specifically, we demonstrated that RNA:DNA hybrids that mimic mRNA pseudoknots can significantly stimulate frameshifting. As predicted by the model, changing the rotational freedom of the structure by altering the lengths in the J1- and R1-oligos between the 5′ and 3′ mRNA hybridizing regions resulted in changes in their abilities to stimulate −1 frameshifting. The demonstration that these ‘pseudo-pseudoknot’ structures cause elongating ribosomes to specifically pause with their A- and P-sites positioned at the slippery site provides independent evidence in support of the model.
In the case of the J-oligo series, frameshifting was best stimulated by J2, suggesting the structure created and the rotational freedom allowed by it was optimal for −1 PRF. The experimental design is such that we assume a similar rate of unfolding for each oligo as the predicted maximum base pairing is the same for them all. However, we do note that the type of nucleotides separating the two, separately paired regions of the oligos, and their presentation, may play a role in −1 PRF efficiency. The recent NMR structural solution of the SRV-1 pseudoknot revealed a highly structured Loop 2–Stem 1 interface including base triples involving an A residue at the 3′ end of Loop 2 (26). The additional base in the J2-oligonucleotide is also an A. Mutagenesis experiments in this region by other groups showed, for example, that replacing the 3′ base in Loop 2 of IBV with an A residue promoted a significant increase in frameshifting efficiency (27), and mutation or removal of the A residue at the 3′ base in Loop 2 of the BWYV pseudoknot reduced frameshifting levels (17). This part of the pseudoknot has been proposed to be important in a frameshifting model where differential transition state energy barriers (due to small differences in local structure, stability or dynamics) are the primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency (3). Indeed, a Loop 2–Stem 1 triplex interaction seen in smaller frameshifting pseudoknots from luteoviruses has been shown to be critical for −1 PRF, and that similar pseudoknots lacking the triplex are less efficient at frameshifting [(28) and references therein]. This extra structural feature would limit the rate of unfolding and provide extra anchoring of Stem 2 as the ribosome attempts to unwind Stem 1, i.e. it too would help to provide additional torsional restraint. It is also possible that although the J3- and J4-oligonucleotides also help to form a pseudo-pseudoknot, the additional bases may interfere with the stabilization of Stem 1.
With the R-oligos, a general correlation was observed between minimization of rotational freedom and frameshifting efficiency, though this was not the case of the R4-oligo. Since the stability of the pseudo-pseudoknot generated with R4 should be similar to that of the other oligonucleotides based on the base-pairing, this result suggests that there are additional considerations to be uncovered with regard to the pseudoknot structure influencing frameshifting. Addition of residues in the R-oligos was analogous to lengthening Loop 1, which is typically short in −1 frameshifting pseudoknots. Limited and conflicting data are available on the importance of Loop 1 in −1 frameshifting pseudoknots. In one study, addition of three A bases to Loop 1 did not affect frameshifting efficiency (15), while in another all the mutations made in this region were detrimental to frameshifting efficiency (17). Given the complex interactions occurring between the helices and loops in this region, we cannot yet account for why the R4-oligo stimulated frameshifting so efficiently and with such variable results.
Examination of the RNA toeprint data presented here reveals that both of the pseudo-pseudoknot structures formed by the J1- and R1-oligos promoted strong stops of the reverse transcriptase ∼16 nt 3′ of the P-site codon of the slippery site, consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of Stem 2 forces ribosomes to pause with their A- and P-sites positioned over the slippery site. Previous studies mapping the lagging edge of paused ribosomes, i.e. mRNA heelprint studies, did not reveal any striking differences between the effects of pseudoknots versus stem–loops (8,16). Interestingly, using this method, the ribosomal pauses appeared distributed over a broader stretch of mRNA (∼4 nt) than observed here. It is possible that some critical level of resolution is lost in the requirement for many additional manipulations of substrates using the mRNA heelprint as compared with the toeprint methods.
A remaining question centers on whether the role of the RNA pseudoknot in −1 PRF is passive or active. In the ‘9 Å solution’ (6), the frameshift mechanism is activated by movement of the A-site codon–anticodon complex by 1 base in the 5′ direction upon accommodation. As currently described, the mRNA pseudoknot merely passively blocks entry of the downstream message into the ribosome, resulting in stretching of the segment of mRNA located between the codon–anticodon complex and the pseudoknot. By this model, all of the energetic input for the frameshift is derived from hydrolysis of GTP by eEF1A. However, it is possible that the pseudoknot may also actively contribute to the frameshift mechanism. Specifically, pulling the downstream message into the ribosome at accommodation could result in unwinding of Stem 1 of the pseudoknot by one additional base pair. The energetic cost of so doing would be to introduce an equivalent amount of torsional resistance into Stem 2. If Stem 2 were to release this resistance by ‘pulling back’, the base pair in Stem 1 would be re-formed, which in turn would contribute to the energy required to dissociate the A- and P-site codon–anticodon complexes from the zero-frame. This would be followed by slippage of the mRNA by 1 base in the 3′ direction relative to the ribosome, followed by the formation of −1 frame codon–anticodon complexes. As such, the proposed active role for the mRNA pseudoknot would further reduce the energetic barrier to −1 PRF. In sum, we suggest that the ‘torsional restraint model’ can be combined with the ‘9 Å solution’ to mechanistically explain the original ‘simultaneous slippage’ model of −1 PRF (9,10). In other words, the 9 Å solution + torsional restraint = simultaneous slippage.
Two recent publications have also shown that oligonucleotide:mRNA duplexes can stimulate efficient −1 ribosomal frameshifting (29,30). These studies differed from the present one in a number of ways, particularly insofar as they examined the effects duplex structures immediately 3′ of the slippery site rather than addressing mRNA pseudoknot related questions. The findings support the notion that the specific location of ribosome pausing on the mRNA plays a critical role in determining frameshifting, though they do come with caveats, e.g. neither study directly mapped ribosomal pausing, and the use of different slippery sites and downstream contexts likely contributed to disparate findings for the optimal distances between the 3′ ends of slippery sites and 5′ ends of frameshift-stimulating oligonucleotides. Although potentially useful therapeutically there are no known natural examples of frameshifting stimulated in this manner, and thus these results do not affect the hypothesis presented here. However, these studies are important in that they raise the possibility for a new role for micro-RNAs in regulating gene expression, and for therapeutic approaches to correcting inborn errors of metabolism due to the presence of frameshift mutations.

7. Correcting errors in synthetic DNA through consensus shuffling
Methods for the automated chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides (1,2) and their assembly into long double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences by PCR (3,4) and LCR (5) have enabled the chemical synthesis of genes and even entire viral genomes (6,7). These technological advances have helped spur the formation of the new field of synthetic biology (8), which aims at defining the functional units of living organisms through the modular engineering of synthetic organisms. In addition, the demand for fully synthetic gene length DNA fragments of defined sequence has dramatically increased in recent years for use in applications such as codon optimization (9), construction of DNA vaccines (10), de novo synthesis of novel biopolymers (11), or simply to gain access to known DNA sequences when original templates are unavailable. The future demand for long synthetic DNA is likely to dramatically increase when it becomes cheaper/faster to synthesize a desired sequence than to obtain it by other means.
The assembly of DNA is currently limited by the presence of random sequence errors in synthetic oligonucleotides that arise from side reactions during synthesis (incomplete couplings, misincorporations, etc.) and resulting in 1–3 errors/kb (7,12,13). The deleterious impact of these errors becomes more significant as the desired lengths of synthetic DNA increase. Indeed, in the remarkable assembly of the PhiX 174 bacteriophage genome (5386 bp) using gel-purified, synthetic oligonucleotides, the products contained an average of ∼2 lethal errors/kb resulting in 1 plaque-forming genomes per 20 000 clones (7). A functional selection (plaque formation) was required in this study to identify a clone with the correct sequence. Thus, error reduction/correction is a requirement for the efficient production of long synthetic DNA of defined sequence. However, the process of sequencing multiple clones and manual correction of errors is both costly and time consuming.
Several methods have been reported for the removal of error-containing sequences in populations of DNA. These methods rely upon the selective destruction (14,15) or physical separation (16,17) of mismatch-containing heteroduplexes. Smith and Modrich (14) reported the selective destruction of error-containing sequences in PCR products by generating dsDNA breaks upon overdigestion with the Escherichia coli mismatch-specific endonuclease MutHLS (18). Gel purification and cloning of the remaining full-length DNA resulted in an apparent 10-fold reduction in the error rate for PCR products. However, the existing approaches are not well suited for error removal in long synthetic DNA sequences where virtually all members in the population contain multiple errors.
Error correction with MutS is outlined in Figure 1. The population of DNA molecules containing random errors is first re-hybridized to expose synthesis errors as mismatches (Figure 1A). Duplexes containing mismatches can then be removed from the population by affinity capture with immobilized MutS (Figure 1B), a process we term coincidence filtering, since both strands of the duplex must match to pass this filtering step. For long synthetic DNA sequences or for sequences with high error rates, coincidence filtering is ineffective, since the likelihood of both strands being perfectly matched after re-hybridization is very low. To generalize MutS error filtering for application on synthetic DNA, the synthetic DNA is cleaved into small overlapping fragments before MutS filtering. Fragments containing mismatches are selectively removed through absorption to an immobilized maltose-binding protein (MBP)–Thermus aquaticus (Taq) MutS–His6 fusion protein (MBP–MutS–H6) (18–20). The remaining mixture of fragments (enriched with fragments of the correct sequence) serves as a template for assembly PCR to produce the full-length product (Figure 1C). This process can be iterated until the consensus sequence emerges as the dominant species in the population. This approach is equivalent to DNA shuffling (21) with additional mismatch exposure and removal steps.
In this report, we assemble GFPuv from synthetic oligonucleotides and apply both coincidence filtering and consensus shuffling protocols to reduce errors in the resultant DNA populations. The error rates are characterized by gene function (fluorescence) and by DNA sequencing. We also provide a mathematical model describing the error reduction protocols to aid predictions about parameters influencing their effectiveness.

Concentrated sample was dialyzed extensively against 2× storage buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA and 0.2 mM DTT) using a Slide-A-Lyzer 10 kDa MWCO cassette at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined using A280 and a calculated extinction coefficient of 119 070 M−1 cm−1. Dialyzed sample was diluted using an equal volume of glycerol and stored at −20°C. The final concentration of MBP–MutS–H6 (M.W. 135, 085) was ∼19.1 μM for a total yield of ∼1.5 mg of protein. Aliquots of sample were taken at each stage of the purification and resolved on an 8% SDS–PAGE gel (Supplementary Figure 1).
Oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen with ‘salt-free’ purification. Sequence 261–1020 of pGFPuv (GenBank accession no. U62636 with T357C, T811A and C812G base substitutions) was assembled using 40mer (37) and 20mer (2) oligonucleotides with 20 bp overlap (Supplementary Table 1). Assembly reactions contained the following components: 64 nM each oligonucleotide, 200 μM dNTPs, 1 mM MgSO4, 1× buffer and 0.02 U/μl KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase. Assembly was carried out using 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min. PCR amplification of assembly products contained the following components: 10-fold dilution of assembly reaction, 25 μM of 20 bp outside primers, 200 μM dNTPs, 1 mM MgSO4, 1× buffer and 0.02 U/μl KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase. PCR was carried out using 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using the Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit with elution in dH2O followed by speed-vac concentration. Assuming an error rate of 1 × 10−6/bp/duplication for KOD DNA polymerase (24), 35 cycles of PCR would be expected to introduce ∼0.053 mutations per assembled GFPuv molecule.
Assembled GFPuv was diluted to 250 ng/μl in 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl and heated to 95°C for 5 min followed by cooling 0.1°C/s to 25°C. Heteroduplex for consensus filtering was split into three pools and digested to completion with NlaIII (NEB), TaqI (NEB) or NcoI plus XhoI (Promega) for 2 h following the manufacturer's protocols. Digests were purified using the Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit with elution in dH2O. Samples were pooled and the concentration was determined by measuring A260.
MBP–MutS–H6 binding reactions contained ∼11.5 ng/μl DNA and ∼950 nM MBP–MutS–H6 dimers in 1× binding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 5% glycerol). Reactions were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min before incubation for 30 min with an equal volume of amylose resin pre-equilibrated in 1× binding buffer. Protein–DNA complexes were removed by low-speed centrifugation and aliquots of supernatant were removed for subsequent processing.
Supernatant (50 μl) from consensus filtering experiments was desalted using Centri-Sep spin columns (Princeton Separations) and concentrated. Purified and concentrated DNA fragments were reassembled as above with aliquots removed at varying cycles. Aliquots of assembly reactions were resolved on 2% agarose gels to monitor the reassembly process. Aliquots showing predominantly reassembled full-length GFPuv were PCR amplified as above. Aliquots of supernatant from coincidence filtering experiments were diluted 10-fold and PCR amplified as above. PCR products were digested with BamHI/EcoRI and ligated into the 2595 bp BamHI–EcoRI fragment of pGFPuv. Ligations were transformed into E.coli DH5 and fluorescent colonies were scored using a handheld 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) lamp.
Ten non-fluorescent GFPuv clones were pooled in equal amounts. The nature and location of the mutations in these clones is shown in Figure 4. The GFP coding region was PCR amplified from the mixture and submitted to the consensus shuffling protocol with and without the application of the MBP–MutS–H6 error filter.
To create an error filter, we constructed a fusion protein between MBP (19) and the mismatch binding protein from T.aquaticus (22) with a C-terminal His6 tag (MBP–MutS–H6). MBP–MutS–H6 was overexpressed and purified from E.coli to >95% purity (Supplementary Figure 1). MBP–MutS–H6 immobilized on amylose resin was shown to selectively retain a 40mer heteroduplex containing a deletion mutation over wild-type homoduplex (Supplementary Figure 2).
To demonstrate error correction, unpurified 40mer oligonucleotides were assembled by PCR (3) to produce a 760 bp gene encoding green fluorescent protein (25) (GFPuv). Two independent preparations of GFPuv containing typical gene synthesis errors (Figure 3 and Table 1) were re-hybridized and subjected to two iterations of coincidence filtering or consensus shuffling. For consensus shuffling, the GFPuv assembly product was split into three pools and digested into sets of overlapping fragments using distinct Type II restriction enzymes (Figure 2). The digests were pooled and subjected to error filtering with or without added MBP–MutS–H6. The unbound fragments were reassembled into full-length products and PCR amplified. For coincidence filtering, unbound full-length GFPuv was PCR amplified following treatment with the error filter. After cloning in E.coli, error rates were estimated by scoring colonies for fluorescence under a handheld UV lamp (Figure 3). The actual error rates of the input and consensus shuffled populations were determined by sequencing plasmid DNA from randomly selected colonies (Figure 3). The results show that two rounds of consensus shuffling increased the percentage of fluorescent colonies from ∼60 to >90% and reduced the error rate of the populations 4.3- and 3.5-fold from values of 1.3 to 0.3 and 0.98 to 0.28 errors/kb, respectively. MBP–MutS–H6 was required to increase the fraction of fluorescent colonies in each round of error filtering. The nature of the errors in the input and consensus shuffled populations are reported in Table 1.
Although DNA shuffling has traditionally been used to create diversity through the combinatorial shuffling of mutations in a population, DNA shuffling also creates a sub-population of sequences with a reduction in diversity, as correct fragments can recombine to produce error-free sequences. Indeed, with consensus shuffling, it is possible to start with a population of DNA molecules wherein every individual in the population contains errors and create a new population where the dominant sequence is error free. To demonstrate this, 10 non-fluorescent GFPuv clones, each containing a deletion mutation (Figure 4), were pooled and subjected to either DNA shuffling alone or two iterations of consensus shuffling. Products were cloned in E.coli, and the percentage of fluorescent colonies was monitored as an indication of progress toward the consensus sequence. DNA shuffling alone (no MBP–MutS–H6) increased the percentage of fluorescent colonies to 30% (387 colonies total) similar to a previous report (26). Two rounds of consensus shuffling gave a new population that was 82% fluorescent (551 colonies total), indicating that the dominant species was likely the consensus sequence of the input population.
Both consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering protocols were effective in reducing errors in synthetic GFPuv populations (Figure 3). In both cases, two iterations of either consensus shuffling or coincidence filtering increased fluorescent colonies from average values of ∼60 to ≥90%. Sequencing data from two independent experiments showed a 4.3- and 3.5-fold reduction in the error rate for the consensus shuffled populations compared with the input populations giving final error rates of 0.3 and 0.28 errors/kb, respectively. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the MBP–MutS–H6 error filter in both consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering protocols. Taq MutS has previously been shown to bind to deletion mutations with high affinity (27), a mutation common in synthetic DNA. However, it is important to note that Taq MutS has lower affinity for specific point mutations and binds weakly to homoduplex DNA (27). These factors may limit the stepwise efficiency of the error filter. Moreover, specific point mutations may be refractory to removal even after multiple rounds of consensus shuffling. Two rounds of consensus shuffling using the MBP–MutS–H6 error filter proved most effective in reducing deletions and G/C to A/T transitions, consistent with previous reports for the selectivity of Taq MutS (27). However, it must be emphasized that each synthetic oligonucleotide point mutation would generate two heteroduplex DNA molecules containing unique mismatches after PCR amplification and re-hybridization (Figure 1A and Table 1). For example, a G to A transition mutation in a synthetic oligonucleotide would generate heteroduplexes with G–T or A–C mismatches after PCR amplification and re-hybridization. For consensus shuffling, either of these mismatch containing heteroduplexes could evade precipitation by the MBP–MutS–H6 error filter and participate in the reassembly of full-length GFPuv. Therefore, Table 1 lists the pair of mismatches that could give rise to the observed transition or transversion mutation. These results show that the MBP–MutS–H6 error filter was most effective at removing insertion/deletion loops and G–T/A–C mismatches from the population.
It should be possible to generalize the consensus shuffling protocol to a large number of synthetic DNA constructs. GFPuv was chosen as the synthetic construct in this study for its advantages as a fluorescent reporter gene. This allowed easy optimization of our protocol without the need to sequence thousands of base pairs of DNA. We expect the results reported here for consensus shuffling to readily translate to synthetic DNA constructs of varied sequence, greater overall length and/or higher initial errors/kb. Synthetic DNA constructs of varied sequence can be digested into a defined set of fragments using Type II restriction enzymes or fragmented into any desired size range using controlled DNase I digestion (26). Digestion and reassembly of a large number of different genes is expected to be as robust as the protocol of DNA shuffling (28), which has been broadly applied to a variety of gene sequences. Synthetic DNA constructs larger than GFPuv are expected to be amenable to error correction by consensus shuffling, as the error filtering is conducted on gene fragments before reassembly of the full-length gene. Thus, the errors/kb data presented in this study are expected to translate to larger genes with similar initial errors/kb (excepting mutations introduced by PCR amplification following the final application of the error filter). Synthetic DNA constructs of higher initial errors/kb are expected to be amenable for error correction by consensus shuffling. However, these constructs will require digestion into smaller sized gene fragments that may affect the efficiency of error correction. In contrast to consensus shuffling, an increase in the size of the synthetic DNA product or an increase in errors/kb would preclude the use of the coincidence filtering protocol, as every molecule in the population would contain one or more errors. As proof of the utility of the consensus shuffling protocol, 10 non-fluorescent GFPuv clones containing one or more errors (Figure 4) were converted into a population where 82% of the clones were fluorescent. It is important to note that DNA shuffling alone shows an improvement in percent fluorescent colonies in this example (from 0 to 30%). For synthetic DNA populations, DNA shuffling alone shows no improvement in percent fluorescent colonies (see Figure 3 ‘no MutS’ treatments). DNA shuffling alone improves the overall number of correct sequences only for small DNA populations with low error rates. For example, when shuffling 10 clones with a unique mutation in each clone, one would expect the fraction of correct products to be (9/10)10 = 35% (26), very close to the value of 30% that we observed. A mathematical model describing the error rates for shuffling and error filtering of synthetic DNA populations is presented below.
To estimate some parameters of consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering, a simple mathematical model (Equations 1–6) was constructed. An input population of dsDNA molecules of length N, containing E errors/base is re-hybridized, fragmented into shorter dsDNA fragments of average length S, error filtered and reassembled. P(F) is the probability a fragment of length S will have a correct sequence. We determine the probability that re-hybridized duplexes will have zero (C), one (H) or both (I) strands with errors. Equation 5 estimates the probability that a fragment will be correct after a cycle of MutS filtering, P(F′), by applying a MutS selectivity factor (M) to adjust the relative amounts of mismatch containing duplexes (I, H) while accounting for the total fraction of correct strands in the re-hybridized duplexes. The probability of obtaining an error free assembly product, P(A), is then given by Equation 6.
1P(F)=(1−E)s
2C=P(F)2
3I=[1−P(F)]2
4H=1−I−C
5P(F′)=2C+HM2C+2HM+2IM
6P(A)=P(F′)NS
From our consensus shuffling error rate data (Figure 3), we estimate the MutS selectivity factor M to be ∼2.2. Figure 5 shows some predictions that emerge from this model assuming typical length (2 kb), fragment sizes (200 bp) and error rates (1.8 errors/kb). Consensus shuffling is predicted to be most effective with smaller fragment sizes (Figure 5A). As mentioned above, smaller fragment sizes could be obtained by controlled digestion with DNase I (21). In addition, multiple iterations of MutS filtering can have dramatic results on populations with few correct sequences (Figure 5B), although the model does not account for the differing specificity of MutS toward the various types of mismatches. The model also predicts that even modest improvements in the MutS selectivity factor through optimization of the MutS–DNA binding conditions and/or the use of a combination of MutS homologs with varying mismatch specificity (29) could dramatically improve the consensus shuffling protocol (Figure 5C). Coincidence filtering (N = S) is predicted to be effective for populations with low error rates per clone (Figure 5D) but becomes ineffective when the majority of re-hybridized duplexes contain mismatches.
We have demonstrated consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering as experimental methods to significantly reduce errors in synthetic DNA. Consensus shuffling should be generally applicable for error correction on synthetic genes of typical lengths and error rates. Two iterations of consensus shuffling (∼6 h/iteration) generated a population with ∼1 error/3500 bp. This reduction in error rate will allow the identification of a correct clone after sequencing DNA from a reduced number of colonies. Coincidence filtering is a simple and effective procedure to reduce errors in synthetic DNA populations with low error rates per clone. These methods should significantly increase the speed and decrease the cost of production of synthetic genes.
Note: While this manuscript was under review, Carr et al. (30) independently reported the application of Taq MutS in protocols for error reduction on synthetic DNA.

8. Towards standardization of RNA quality assessment using user-independent classifiers of microcapillary electrophoresis traces
Purity and integrity of RNA are critical elements for the overall success of RNA-based analyses, including gene expression profiling methods to assess the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single assay. Starting with low quality RNA may strongly compromise the results of downstream applications which are often labor-intensive, time-consuming and highly expensive. However, in spite of the need for standardization of RNA sample quality control, presently there is no real consensus on the best classification criteria. Conventional methods are often not sensitive enough, not specific for single-stranded RNA, and susceptible to interferences from contaminants present in the sample. For instance, when using a spectrophotometer, a ratio of absorbances at 260 and 280 nm (A260:A280) greater than 1.8 is usually considered an acceptable indicator of RNA purity (1,2). However, the A260 measurement can be compromised by the presence of genomic DNA leading to over-estimation of the actual RNA concentration. On the other hand, the A280 measurement will estimate the presence of protein but provide no hint on possible residual organic contaminants, considered at 230 nm (3–5). Pure RNA will have A260:A230 equal to A260:A280 and >1.8 (1). A second check involves electrophoresis analysis, routinely performed using agarose gel electrophoresis, with RNA either stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) (6–9), or the more sensitive SYBR Green dye (10). The proportion of the ribosomal bands (28S:18S) has conventionally been viewed as the primary indicator of RNA integrity, with a ratio of 2.0 considered to be typical of ‘high quality’ intact RNA (1). However, these methods are highly sample-consuming, using 0.5–2 μg total RNA and often not sensitive enough to detect slight RNA degradation. Today, microfluidic capillary electrophoresis with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) has become widely used, particularly in the gene expression profiling platforms (11,12). It requires only a very small amount of RNA sample (as low as 200 pg), the use of a size standard during electrophoresis allows the estimation of sizes of RNA bands and the measurement appears relatively unaffected by contaminants. Integrity of the RNA may be assessed by visualization of the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands (Figure 1A and B); an elevated threshold baseline and a decreased 28S:18S ratio, both are indicative of degradation. A broad band shows DNA contamination (Figure 1C). As it is apparent from a review of the literature, the standard of a 2.0 rRNA ratio is difficult to meet, especially for RNA derived from clinical samples, and it now appears that the relationship between the rRNA profile and mRNA integrity is somewhat unclear (13–23). On the one hand, this may reflect unspecific damage to the RNA, including sample mishandling, postmortem degradation, massive apoptosis or necrosis, but it can reflect specific regulatory processes or external factors within the living cells. Altogether, it appears that total RNA with lower rRNA ratios is not necessarily of poor quality especially if no degradation products can be observed in the electrophoretic trace (Figure 1D).
For all these reasons, the development of a reliable, fully integrated and automated system appropriate for numeric evaluation of RNA integrity is highly desirable. Standardized RNA quality assessment would allow a more reliable comparison of experiments and facilitate exchange of biological information within the scientific community. With that prospect in mind, and with the aim of anticipating future standards by pre-normative research, we identified and tested two software packages recently developed to gauge the integrity of RNA samples with a user-independent strategy: one open source, the degradometer software for calculation of the degradation factor and ‘true’ 28S:18S ratio based on peak heights (24) and the freely available RIN algorithm of the Agilent 2100 expert software, based on computation of a ‘RNA Integrity Number’ (RIN) (25). Both tools were developed separately to extract information about RNA integrity from microcapillary electrophoretic traces and produce a user-independent metrics. Using these tools, we assessed the purity and integrity of 414 RNA samples, derived from 14 different human adult tissues and cell lines, many of which representing tumors. Those results were compared with conventional RNA quality measurement approaches as well as with highly expert human interpretation. We evaluated the simplicity for users and examined the potential, accuracy and efficiency of each method to contribute to standardization of RNA integrity assessment upstream of biological assays. These procedures were further validated by real-time RT–PCR quantitation of the expression levels of three housekeeping genes, using the same RNA samples, at different levels of degradation.
Total RNA was prepared from human cell lines (especially from the ATCC bio-resource center, N = 50) and tissue samples (clinical samples, N = 285) from 13 different human adult tissue types, i.e. blood, brain, breast, colon, epithelium, kidney, lymphoma, lung, liver, muscle, prostate, rectum and thyroid. RNA purification was performed by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (26), by phenol-based extraction methods (TRIzol reagent, Invitrogen, USA), or silica gel-based purification methods (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Germany; Strataprep kit, Stratagene, USA or SV RNA isolation kit, Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Material was maintained at −80°C with minimal handling. RNA extraction was carried out in an RNase-free environment (see Supplementary Table 1 online).
The commercially available RNA samples were the ‘Universal Human Reference’ (N = 75) distributed by Stratagene (USA), and human brain (N = 2) and muscle (N = 2) RNAs supplied by Clontech (USA).
Once extracted, RNA concentration and purity was first verified by UV measurement, using the Ultrospec3100 pro (Amersham Biosciences, USA) and 5 mm cuvettes. The absorbance (A) spectra were measured from 200 to 340 nm. A230, A260 and A280 were determined. A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios were calculated. For microcapillary electrophoresis measurements, the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used in conjunction with the RNA 6000 Nano and the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip kits. In total, 39 assays were run in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (see Supplementary Notes online). To evaluate the reliability of the classifier systems described in this study, replicate runs were done on a set of 56 RNA samples loaded on different chips, resulting in 2 (N = 41), 3 (N = 12), 7 (N = 2) and 50 (N = 1) data points per sample.
RNA integrity checking was performed by expert operators who classified each total RNA sample within a predefined discrete category from 1 to 5, examining the integrity of the RNA from electropherograms (see Supplementary Table 2 online). A low number indicates high integrity. Reference criteria parameters include ribosomal peaks definition, baseline flatness, existence of additional or noise peaks between ribosomal peaks, low molecular weight species contamination and genomic DNA presence suspicion. A smearing of either 28S and 18S peaks, or a decrease in their intensity ratio indicate degradation of the RNA sample and results in the classification into the higher categories. To evaluate the robustness of this human interpretation, five highly experienced operators, trained in these cataloging steps, separately classified a subset of 33 samples from breast cancers. It included samples with varying levels of integrity: intact RNA (33%), low quality samples (20%) and a wide range of degradation (47%).
Bioanalyzer electrophoretic data were exported in the degradometer software folder (.cld format). For comparison of samples, the original data were re-scaled by the classifier system, first along the time-axis to compensate for differences in migration time, then along the fluorescence intensity-axis to compensate for variation in total RNA amount. As a result, fluorescence curves that have the same shape will have the same peak heights after re-scaling. Then, Degradation Factors (DegFact) and corrected 28S:18S ratios were calculated (see Supplementary Table 3 online) using the mathematical model developed by Auer et al. (24), examining additional ‘degradation peak signals’ appearing in the lower molecular weight range and comparing them to ribosomal peak heights. Calculation of the DegFact is based on a numbering of continuous metrics, ranging from 1 to ∞; increasing DegFact values correspond to more degradation, and a new group of integrity is defined after 8 graduation steps. Once the classification of the RNA samples is completed, 4 groups of integrity are displayed, 3 showing an alert warning indicative of some measurable degradation (Yellow: 8–16, Orange: 16–24 and Red: ≥24), while all non-reliable data come together and form the fourth group (Black). We introduced a fifth class labeled White (<8), when no alert was produced by the software.
Software and manual are freely available at . Degradometer version 1.4.1 (released in May 2004) of the software was used.
Bioanalyzer electrophoretic sizing files (.cld format) collected with biosizing software version A.02.12.SI292 (released in March 2003) were imported in the Agilent 2100 expert software (RIN beta release). The RIN algorithm allows calculation of RNA integrity using a trained artificial neural network based on the determination of the most informative features that can be extracted from the electrophoretic traces out of 100 features identified through signal analysis. The selected features which collectively catch the most information about the integrity levels include the total RNA ratio (ratio of area of ribosomal bands to total area of the electropherogram), the height of the 18S peak, the fast area ratio (ratio of the area in the fast region to the total area of the electropherogram) and the height of the lower marker.
A total of 1300 electropherograms of RNA samples from various tissues of three mammalian species (human, mouse and rat), showing varying levels of degradation and an adaptive learning approach were used in order to assign a weight factor to the relevant features that describe the RNA integrity. A RIN number is computed for each RNA profile (see Supplementary Table 4 online) resulting in the classification of RNA samples in 10 numerically predefined categories of integrity. The output RIN is a decimal or integer number in the range of 1–10: a RIN of 1 is returned for a completely degraded RNA samples whereas a RIN of 10 is achieved for intact RNA sample.
In some cases, the measured electropherogram signals are of an unusual shape, showing for example peaks at unexpected migration times, spikes or abnormal fluctuation of the baseline. In such cases, a reliable RIN computation is not possible. Several separate neural networks were trained to recognize such anomalies and display a warning to the user or even suppress the display of a RIN number. Combining the results of the neural network for the RIN computation and the neural networks to detect anomalies, the RIN algorithm achieves a mean square error of 0.1 and a mean absolute error of 0.25 on an independent test set.
The beta release of the software and manual are freely available at . Agilent 2100 expert version B.01.03.SI144 (released in November 2003) of the software was used.
Expression levels of three housekeeping genes (HKG)—GAPD, GUSB and TFRC—were measured by quantitative PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, USA). Sixteen aliquots of a unique batch of RNA sample (Universal Human Reference RNA, Stratagene, USA) of various levels of integrity (cf. Table 1) were used to test the influence of RNA quality on the relative expression of those three genes. In parallel, a 5′ to 3′ comparison was done using two separate GUSB and TFRC TaqMan probes.
An homogeneous quantity (0.8–1 μg) of the RNA samples was subjected to a reverse transcription step using the high-capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) as described by the manufacturer. Single-stranded cDNA products were then analyzed by real-time PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, USA). Single-stranded cDNA products were analyzed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, USA). The efficiency and reproducibility of the reverse transcription were tested using 18S rRNA TaqMan probes. Five assays were used, GAPDH-5′ (Hs99999905_m1), GUSB-5′ (Hs00388632_gH), GUSB-3′ (Hs99999908_m1), TFRC-5′ (Hs00951086_m1) and TFRC-3′ (Hs00951085_m1). In each case, duplicate threshold cycle (Ct) values were obtained and averaged; then expression levels were evaluated by a relative quantification method (27). The fold change in one tested HKG (target gene) was normalized to the 18S rRNA (reference gene) and compared to the highest quality sample (calibrator sample), using the following formula: Fold change = 2−ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = (Ct-target − Ct-reference)sample-n − (Ct-target − Ct-reference)calibrator-sample. Sample-n corresponds to any sample for the target gene normalized to the reference gene and calibrator-sample represents the expression level (1×) of the target gene normalized to the reference gene considering the highest quality sample. Mean 2−ΔΔCt and SD were calculated, considering the samples either individually or grouped by quality metrics categories, based on RIN metrics or DegFact values, together with the lower and upper bound mean of 95% Intervals of Confidence (IC). Using this analysis, if the expression levels of the HKG are not affected by the RNA degradation, the values of the mean fold change at each condition should be very close to 1 (since 20 = 1) (27).
Descriptive statistics were executed using the XLstat software, version 7.1 (Addinsoft, USA), P = 0.05. Mean, SD and coefficient of variation (variation or CV) between and within groups of samples were calculated, together with a measure of the dispersion (range), inter-quartile range (1st and 3rd quartiles, Q1–Q3) and evaluation of the lower and upper bound mean of 95% Interval of Confidence (IC). Comparative statistical analyses between groups were completed, P = 0.05, using non-parametric statistical tests: two-independent Mann–Whitney U-test and k-independent Kruskal–Wallis test.
Following extraction, RNA purity was directly determined by UV measurement from the A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios. We found an average A260:A280 ratio of 1.89 [Interval of Confidence (IC) 1.88–1.90] with 92% of the values falling within the theoretically expected range (1.8–2.1) (Figure 2A), and an average A260:A230 ratio of 1.99 (IC 1.92–2.06), with 73% of the values greater than 1.8 (See Supplementary Table 1 online for details). Significant differences in A260:A280 ratios were observed between specific groups of samples (i.e. tumoral versus normal or tissues versus cell lines). For instance, RNA extracted from normal samples displayed an improved ratio of 1.97, with 97% falling within the desired range (Figure 2A). In contrast, the distribution of A260:A280 ratios was not found to correlate with either purification methods or tissues of origin.
RNA integrity was further assessed by resolving the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 protocol. The analysis was done on 399 RNA profiles; data from 15 samples was not obtained due to device problems during the runs. The system automatically provided 28S:18S ratios for 348 (87%) of the 399 profiles. Figure 2B shows the distribution of the 28S:18S computed values, with a median ratio around 1.7 and a variation of 54% from the mean (IC 1.9–2.1 and Q1–Q3 1.4–2.5). In addition, a significant degree of variability of the 28S:18S ratio (19–24%) was found for identical samples from replicate runs (2–50 times). Among those RNA samples, 28S:18S ratios of 2.0 or greater were rare, less than 44% of the values measured being within the theoretically desired range, except for the samples prepared from cultured cells (Figure 2B). The integration failed in the remaining 51 cases, displaying an atypical migration, with no clear 28S and 18S rRNA bands, and no 28S:18S ratio was computed (data not shown).
Expert operators categorized the set of RNA samples by inspecting the electrophoretic traces of successful assays. Over the 399 RNA profiles checked, 379 (95%) were scored within predefined categories (Figure 2C), namely good [Human Categorization (HC)-level 1], regular (HC-level 2), moderate (HC-level 3), low (HC-level 4) and degraded (HC-level 5). The remaining 20 (5%) were flagged as displaying a temperature-sensitive profile: RNA samples initially found intact became highly degraded when heated, although no RNase contamination was observed (data not shown). Estimation of the robustness of this cataloging was done through comparison of qualifying criteria using a set of 33 breast cancer samples (see Materials and Methods). Integrity of the samples was evaluated independently by five expert operators, and categorization was found highly reliable with a coefficient variation (CV) ∼16%. This is low considering that individual interpretation is involved, but can be explained by the fact that very experienced operators accomplished the scoring based on a clearly defined set of instructions, thus limiting frequently observed subjective visual interpretation and inconsistency of human categorization.
Predictably, a 28S:18S ratio of 2.0 denoted high quality for a majority of RNA samples, 91% being classified in HC-levels 1 to 3. However, 83% of total RNAs with 28S:18S ≥ 1.0 but a low baseline between the 18S and 5S rRNA or front marker were also classified in HC-levels 1–3 (see Figure 1D) and could be considered suitable for most downstream applications.
RNA degradation was first assessed using the degradometer software (see Materials and Methods). Over the 399 RNA profiles checked, all were scored in one of the five predefined classes (Figure 3A). Altogether, 334 (84%) Degradation Factors (DegFact) values were computed, the remaining 65 RNA samples (16%) displaying profiles that could not be interpreted reliably; no DegFact values could be scored, and samples were flagged in the Black category (Figure 3A). Most of them (80%) correspond to samples previously classified by our operators as degraded (HC-level 5). The remaining cases had an average degradation factor of 7.5 (IC 6.7–8.3) with large variations over the entire set of samples (over 103% from the mean, range 1–52). A lower variability was persistently found when identical samples from replicate runs were considered, resulting in observed DegFact values with a 26–32% CV. In addition, statistically significant differences were found between DegFact values of samples sorted by types. The highest DegFact values were found characteristic of tissue samples, 41% of them displaying a DegFact > 8, as compared with 6% for the cell lines (data not shown).
Remarkably, we found a significant linear relationship between the DegFact values distribution and the explicit human categorization. Most HC classes corresponded to an unambiguous DegFact distribution (Figure 3B), while HC-levels 2 and 3 form a single class: HC-level 1, mean DegFact of 3.3, SD of 2.8 (IC 2.8–3.7); HC-level 2 and 3, mean DegFact of 8.8, SD of 6.8 (IC 7.5–10.2); HC-level 4, mean DegFact of 15.9, SD of 7.8 (IC 12.7–19.1); HC-level 5, mean DegFact of 26.0, SD of 7.5 (IC 21.9–30.1). It is worth mentioning that the normalized heights of 18S and 28S peaks, and the interval between them after rescaling gradually decrease and then reverse with increasing degradation (Figure 3B).
Integrity of RNA samples was measured in parallel based on the RNA Integrity Number metrics using an artificial neural network trained to distinguish between different RNA integrity levels by examining the shape of the microcapillary electrophoretic traces (see Materials and Methods). Over the 399 RNA profiles checked, 363 (91%) were scored successfully (Figure 4A), with an average RIN of 7.7 (IC 7.4–8.0). The remaining 36 (9%) samples were associated with various unexpected signals, disturbing computation of the RIN using default anomaly detection parameters. In each case, a flag alert was added corresponding to critical anomalies including unexpected data in sample type, (or) ribosomal ratio, (or) baseline and signal in the 5S region (data not shown).
RIN categorization was found regular, variability between replicate runs, compared to the other methods, being consistently very small (CV 8–12%). As expected, the highest RIN were characteristic of cell line samples, 72% of them displaying a RIN ≥ 9, as compared with 47% for the tissue samples (data not shown).
A first group, corresponding to 295 (82%) of the 363 RNA profiles, was analyzed using the default settings of the RIN system, but with a lower threshold of RNA quantity loaded (20 ng) for reliable detection of anomalies than that recommended by the manufacturer (50 ng). A significant linear relationship was found between the RIN number and both the explicit human classification provided by our operators, and the DegFact values calculated by the degradometer software (Figure 4B). Each distinct HC class corresponds to an explicit RIN number, with HC-levels 2 and 3 forming once again a single class: HC-level 1, mean RIN of 9.6, SD of 0.7 (IC 9.5–9.7); HC-level 2 and 3, mean RIN of 8.6, SD of 0.9 (IC 8.4–8.9); HC-level 4, mean RIN of 6.1, SD of 1.5 (IC 5.2–7.1); HC-level 5, mean RIN of 3.7, SD of 2.0 (IC 2.9–4.5).
For the remaining 68 samples (assay done with <20 ng of RNA), two separate groups were considered: 41 samples with a computed RIN below 5.0, and 27 above 7.0. All samples in the first group were derived from RNA 6000 Nano assays, with mean RNA quantities loaded below 10 ng (Q1–Q3, 5–12 ng), i.e. below the lower limit of quantitation indicated by the manufacturer. All but 8 of these samples were estimated by our operators to be of poor quality (HC-level 4; N = 3) or degraded (HC-level 5; N = 30), and all but 4 were flagged Black by the degradometer software and no DegFact values were scored. These RNA profiles could not be interpreted reliably, possibly due to either the low RNA concentration or the unusual migration behavior and shifted baseline values of degraded samples. Thus, the two automated systems were in disagreement for these samples; while human interpretation was in most cases in agreement with the RIN system, with less than 20% of inconsistency. In the second group of 27 samples, 20 of the profiles were derived from RNA 6000 Pico assays with RNA quantities loaded being on average below 4 ng (Q1–Q3, 0.5–0.8 ng), which is within the manufacturer specifications. All but 3 of them were estimated by our operators to range from high (HC-level 1; N = 12) to correct (HC-level 2 and 3; N = 12) quality levels. In addition, all RNA profiles except 1 were scored by the degradometer software, most of them displaying an alert flag (N = 20); some slight degradation was detected, associated to a low mean DegFact value of 9.7 (IC 8.1–11.3; Q1–Q3, 6.2–12.6). Thus, both automated systems and human interpretations agreed in most of these cases, with <11% of inconsistency.
The influence of RNA quality categorization obtained with both user-independent classifiers on gene expression profiling was explored using real-time RT–PCR. The expression levels of three housekeeping genes (HKG)—GAPDH, GUSB and TFRC—were measured in 16 aliquots of a unique RNA displaying various integrity metrics (Table 1). The mean correlation coefficient (r) between the threshold cycle (Ct) among the 16 samples and both quality metrics was found high: r = −0.87 considering the RIN metrics and r = 0.85 considering the DegFact values. The values of the mean fold changes, calculated according to the 2−ΔΔCt quantification method (see Materials and Methods), were found lower than 1.0, corresponding to the expression level (1×) in the sample exhibiting the highest RNA quality (Table 2 and Figure 5). Considering that HKG expression was measured relative to the reference sample, an obvious decline of the relative expression levels was observed, up to 24, 70 and 82%, in samples categorized according to the RIN metrics (Figure 5A) and DegFact values (Figure 5B). These results indicate that 2- to 7-fold differences may be expected in the relative expression levels of genes in samples that differ only by their quality (Table 2). These fold differences are much larger than those measured for RNA samples of comparable integrity, consistently lower than 1.6 (Table 2 and Figure 5). In addition, an unambiguous gap in the distribution may be defined (Figure 5A and B), distinguishing the RNA samples of the higher quality categories (RIN ≥ 8 and DegFact values < 7) from those of the lower categories (RIN < 8 and DegFact values ≥ 12).
It would be expected that measuring expression of an intact mRNA would yield approximately equal results regardless of the region being probed, and if mRNA fragmentation had occurred, then some sequences may be more abundant than others. We thus tested the effect of PCR probe location on the RNAs. The 5′ and 3′ GUSB probes, separated by 1209 nt, were associated with highly similar threshold cycle (Ct) measures (r = 0.98, β parameter = 0.88) (Figure 5C). Similar results were obtained for TFRC, with probes separated by 2066 nt (r = 0.84, β parameter = 0.92, data not shown). It seems therefore that the region being probed is not a source of variation in our results.
It is universally accepted that RNA purity and integrity are of foremost importance to ensure reliability and reproducibility of downstream applications. In the biomedical literature (PubMed, November 2004), from the 485 090 articles that relate to RNA, and the 287 515 or 40 395 including respectively the ‘quality’ or ‘integrity’ term, less than 100 were found to contain ‘RNA quality’ or ‘RNA integrity’ terms. Interestingly, half of them were published between 2001 and 2004; but none is proposing a standard operational procedure for RNA quality assessment to the scientific community. Except for two studies (24,25), those reports are based on 10 to 15 years old methods (1), indicating that they represent the established and currently mostly used methods. Our results strongly challenge the reliability and usefulness of those conventional methods, demonstrating their inconsistency to evaluate RNA quality.
First, the A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios are reflecting RNA purity, but are not informative regarding the integrity of the RNA. Available RNA extraction and purification methods yield highly pure RNA with very little DNA or other contaminations, resulting most often in both ratios ≫1.8, although 18% of the samples were found degraded and 7% more of poor quality. The high A260:A280 ratios are indicative of limited protein contaminations, whereas high A260:A230 ratios are indicative of an absence of residual contamination by organic compounds such as phenol, sugar or alcohol, which could be highly detrimental to downstream applications. Nonetheless, samples displaying low A260:A230 ratios (≪1.8) did not exhibit any inhibition during downstream applications, such as cDNA synthesis and labeling or in vitro transcription (data not shown). Second, due to a lack of reliability, the 28S:18S rRNA ratios may not be used as a gold standard for assessing RNA integrity. When ribosomal ratios were calculated from identical samples but through independent runs, a large degree of variability (CV 19–24%) was observed. Moreover, using the biosizing software, we found 28S:18S rRNA ratios evaluation compromised by the fact that their calculation is based on area measurements and therefore heavily dependent on definition of start and end points of peaks. In 13% of the cases, the system was unable to localize the ribosomal peaks, and therefore no 28S:18S ratios were computed. For the remaining samples, no clear correlation between 28S:18S ratios and RNA integrity was found although RNAs with 28S:18S >2.0 were usually of high quality. Most of the RNAs we studied (83%), displaying a 28S:18S > 1.0, could be considered of good quality. Interestingly, Auer et al. (24) in a study on 19 tissues from seven organisms, reported that an objective measurement of the RNA integrity may possibly be done through comparison of re-scaled 28S and 18S peak heights, but not of the corresponding areas. Actually, we observed a linear relationship between RNA integrity and differences in normalized 28S and 18S peak heights. Increased degradation resulted in a significant decrease in the scaled corrected heights of the ribosomal peaks, with inversion of the ratio at the highly degraded stages (cf. Figure 3B). In comparison to the area computation, 28S:18S rRNA re-scaled peak height measurement produced more consistent values, with a CV reduced to 12–14%, and displayed clear concentration-independent values (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 3 online). Human evaluation of the integrity of RNA through visual inspection of the electrophoresis profiles provided very consistent data. Variability between classifications produced by five independent expert operators (CV 16%) was lower than with automated management of more conventional control 28S:18S area values (CV 19–24%). It is, however, very time-consuming and strongly dependent on individual competence. Even with highly trained specialists, 5% of the set of RNA samples could not be allocated to any of the five predefined categories; their corresponding profiles were considered by our experts as atypical, displaying a temperature-sensitive shape (data not shown).
These strategies appear unsuitable for standardization and quality control of RNA integrity assessment, which require simple but consistent expert-independent classification, facilitating information exchanges between laboratories. We therefore investigated the performance of two recently developed user-independent software algorithms (24,25). The degradometer software provided a reliable evaluation of RNA integrity based on the identification of additional ‘degradation peak signals’ and their integration in a mathematical calculation together with the ribosomal peak heights. It allowed characterization of the integrity of 84% of the samples tested, one-third with an alert flag, which was first found to be fairly informative, as it strongly reduces the complexity of the metrics by introducing three distinct classes labeled Yellow, Orange and Red, and can be used as a first straightforward simple filtering step. However, degradation factors (DegFact) metrics yield precise measures with less than 32% CV and are much more valuable than flag alerts for the purpose of standardization. The same is true for the RNA Integrity Number ‘RIN’ software which allowed the characterization of the integrity of 91% of the RNA samples tested, with a RIN value for 363 RNA sample profiles with less than 12% CV. In general, there was a good agreement between the human classification, the degradation factor and the RIN (see Figure 4B). This provided a cross-validation of the user-independent qualification systems tested. Both resulted in the refinement of human interpretations, validating four statistically relevant classes of samples, namely good (HC-level 1), regular/moderate (HC-level 2 and 3), poor (HC-level 4) and degraded (HC-level 5). Moreover, the 5% RNA samples previously flagged by the operators as displaying an atypical temperature-sensitive shape were unambiguously assigned to one or the other category of samples [RIN = 7.3 (IC 6.8–7.8); DegFact = 11.9 (IC 9.5–14.2); data not shown].
Altogether, we found the degradometer and RIN algorithms to be highly reliable user-independent methods for automated assessment of RNA degradation and integrity. The RIN system is a slightly more informative tool, able to compute assessment metrics for 91% of the RNA profiles, compared to 84% with the degradometer software; the remaining being flagged respectively as N/A or Black alert. For samples available below a low limit of 20 ng (N = 80) the RIN system provided metric values for 85% of them, compared to only 46% with the degradometer software. Similarly, the RIN system was able to provide metric values for 81% of poor quality samples (including low quality and degraded samples; N = 96), whereas the degradometer software could classify only 44% of them. Another advantage with the RIN classifier is that, if there are critical anomalies detected (including genomic DNA contamination, wavy baseline, etc.), threshold settings may be changed and a reliable RIN value computed. This was the case for 25 of the 363 RNA sample profiles successfully classified by the system.
While intact RNA obviously constitutes the best representation of the natural state of the transcriptome, there are situations in which gene expression analysis may be desirable even on partially degraded RNA. Some studies report collection of reasonable microarray data from RNA samples of impaired quality (28), leading to meaningful results if used carefully. Moreover, Auer et al. (24) recently concluded that degradation does not preclude microarray analysis if comparison is done using samples of comparable RNA integrity. We confirmed the direct influence of the RNA quality on the distribution of gene expression levels, by detecting using Q-PCR a significant (up to 7-fold) difference in the relative expression of genes in samples of slightly decreased RNA integrity, which is much larger than the variation within comparable RNA quality categories (cf. Figure 5 and Table 2). This may correlate with ratio discrepancies in gene expression experiments, and therefore with false positive and false negative rates of differential gene expression when comparing two samples. Therefore, computing reliable metrics of RNA integrity, even if the RNA is found to be partially degraded, may be highly valuable. The straight and unambiguous relationships established between human interpretations and both RIN and DegFact distributions indicates that, using these metrics, it should be possible to distinguish specific samples that are too disparate to be included in comparative gene expression analyses without compromising the results. Although the information provided by these user-independent classifiers is not a guarantee for successful downstream experiments, it gives a more comprehensive picture of the samples and can be used as a safeguard against performing useless and costly experiments.
Thus, the RIN system may be used as simple metrics that can be easily integrated in any sample tracking information system for definition of standard operating procedures under quality assurance following a scheme such as the one described in Figure 6. In this context, we suggest that the growing number of laboratories performing RNA Quality Control by microcapillary electrophoresis should be offered the option to report objective RNA quality metrics as part of the ‘Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment’ MIAME standards (29). Through registration of RNA profiles in a public electronic repository, such standardized information should enable and facilitate comparisons of RNA-based bioassays performed across laboratories with RNA samples of similar quality, in much the same way as sequencing traces are compared.

9. Management of Critically Ill Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus involved 26 countries and 8098 patients, resulted in 774 deaths 1. Thereafter, SARS has re-emerged sporadically in both laboratory and community settings. Its clinical spectrum varies from minimal respiratory symptoms to severe respiratory failure. We have previously contributed to an overview on the contemporary treatment of SARS 2, and the whole topic has also been reviewed elsewhere 3. In this article, we aim to focus on the management of a subgroup of critically ill SARS patients with more significant respiratory failure. 
Critically ill SARS patients frequently demonstrate the following clinical features: persistent pyrexia (occasionally from admission but often recurring after an initial period of defervescence), tachycardia (infrequently bradycardia), tachypnoea and significant oxygen desaturation. More than one-third of all the SARS patients required high flow oxygen therapy 4, 20–30% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission or high dependency care, and 13–26% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 5,6. The clinical course of some of these patients can progress relentlessly irrespective of all attempts at pharmacological treatment, eventually resulting in septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
Lymphocytopaenia, neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia are frequently seen in critically ill SARS patients. Neutrophilia could be due to SARS per se, to superimposed infection or related to corticosteroid administration. Pancytopaenia, if present, could be due to haemophagocytosis syndrome 7 or reactivation of latent human parvovirus (unpublished data). Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and picture of disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported 8. Co-infections with other agents including Chlamydia-like agents 9, metapneumovirus 10 or influenza virus (unpublished data) have been reported. Persistent and increasing elevations of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and transaminases levels are common 11,12,13. Associated lung damage is believed to be the result of a virally-triggered inflammatory reaction mediated by a host of cytokines 14,15. In sicker patients, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, TNF-α) and TGF-β1 were higher, with slower decline on clinical recovery 14.
Radiographic abnormalities in the chest usually progress upwards from initial unilateral or bilateral lower-to mid-zone peripheral ground-glass shadows, to focal, multifocal or diffuse consolidation. Peak radiographic changes occurred at 8.6 days after fever onset, with 17.4% showing two peaks at 6.3 and 13.5 days, and 4% showing relentless progression 16. Cavitation is rare but may be associated with superimposed infection in patients with a prolonged illness course and who are mechanically ventilated 17. High-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) of the thorax showed focal ground-glass and scattered “crazy paving” patterns at presentation, followed by development of interstitial thickening, consolidation, pleural reaction, and scarring and fibrosis in later stages 18,19. Small (<1 cm) pulmonary cysts may be detected even if the patient is not receiving ventilatory assistance 19. Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothoraces or pneumomediastinum are distinct complications of severe SARS 18. HRCT features of late-stage ARDS caused by SARS are similar to those arising from other causes 19.
Lung biopsy and postmortem studies 20,21 showed acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, bronchiolar fibrin, increased numbers of interstitial macrophages (with focal haemophagocytosis) and alveolar macrophages in patients with shorter duration (<10 days) of illness. On the other hand, histology after >10days of illness showed organizing-phase DAD with increased fibrosis, hyperplasia of type II pneumocyte, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia 20. In patients who died late in the course of this disease, high loads of viral RNA were detectable by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the lungs, bowel, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidneys 22. 
Anti-bacterial therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in accordance with standard guidelines 23 should always be administered before laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection. Where effective anti-viral therapy is available, it should be started as early as possible after diagnosis, and even empirically if suspicious clinical features and especially epidemiological links are present. Since critically ill patients are deemed to have already progressed from the viral replicative phase to the immunopathological phase 5, concomitant institution of an immunomodulatory therapy should also be considered 11. Since there are no consensus regarding the most optimal treatment regimen in these respects, we will thus review the more commonly used agents and discuss their relative merits based on published reports. When respiratory failure eventually sets in, oxygen supplementation, assisted ventilation and intensive supportive treatments will be required.
Ribavirin was the most commonly used empirical antiviral agent for SARS. It is a broad-spectrum purine nucleoside analogue which inhibits both RNA and DNA viruses by interfering with nucleic acid synthesis. There is experimental evidence to show that it has immunomodulatory effects in the treatment of mouse coronavirus hepatitis 24. Subsequently, it was found that ribavirin has no direct in vitro activity against SARS-CoV 25. Higher doses given intravenously resulted in more frequent and severe adverse effects including haemolytic anaemia, elevated transaminase levels and bradycardia 13.
Lopinavir-ritonavir co-formulation (Kaletra®, Abbott Laboratories, USA) is a protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It can inhibit the coronaviral proteases, thus blocking the processing of viral replicase polyprotein and preventing the replication of viral RNA. Ritonavir inhibits lopinavir metabolism thus increasing its serum concentration, but it has no activity against SARS-CoV. In a retrospective analysis in Hong Kong 26, 31 patients who had received Kaletra as rescue therapy together with high dose corticosteroids had no difference in rates of oxygen desaturation, intubation and mortality compared with a matched cohort. However, when given as initial treatment in combination with ribavirin in another subgroup of 44 patients, there were significant reductions in the need for rescue pulsed corticosteroid therapy, intubation rate and overall mortality. In addition to the prevalence of diarrhoea among these patients which may render oral drugs more appropriate and useful, synergism between kaletra and ribavirin might have contributed to the benefits since either drug alone has only weak anti-viral activities. Another Hong Kong study of 41 SARS patients treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin compared with 111 patients (historical controls) treated with ribavirin only showed that adverse clinical outcomes (ARDS or death) were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the historical controls at day 21 after symptom onset. Further randomised placebo controlled trials are required 27.
Interferons are a family of cytokines with important roles in the cellular immune response. Interferon α has been used for SARS treatment in China and Canada 28,29,30. In an open-label uncontrolled study 28, nine patients treated with corticosteroids plus interferon alfacon-1 (Infergen®, InterMune Inc., USA) showed better oxygen saturation, faster radiographic resolution and lesser need for supplemental oxygen compared to 13 given corticosteroids alone. In vitro testing showed that interferon β was more potent than interferon α or γ, being effective even when administered after SARS-CoV infection in cell culture 31.
Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been used concomitantly with other drugs to treat SARS in mainland China with good results reported 32. However, its value in critically ill patients has not been reported. Glycyrrhizin, an active component derived from liquorice roots, is effective against SARS-CoV in vitro 
25. Its clinical utility remains uncertain. Another herbal compound, Baicalin, also demonstrates anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro (unpublished data).
In the absence of an effective antiviral agent in the 2003 outbreak, most physicians had opted to use immunomodulatory agents, most commonly corticosteroids, in the treatment of SARS 11,12,33,34 It is generally agreed that corticosteroids should not be used during the early viral replicative phase, and that its administration should best coincide with the onset of the immunopathological phase 5. Clinico-radiological surrogate criteria have been used to indicate the onset of this immune hyperactive phase, thus providing a practical guide to the timing of starting corticosteroids 11. Corticosteroid dosages should be high enough, especially in the severe cases, to abort the cytokine storm, and maintained for long enough to prevent the rebound phenomenon 2,29,35. This may be achieved by using a weight-adjusted 11 and radiographic extent-modified dosages 29 for a period of 2–3 weeks.
In one-third to half of SARS patients, fever may recur while on immunomodulatory treatment due to superimposed infections, too rapid tailing of corticosteroids or persistently severe and uninhibited cytokine storm. Empirical anti-pseudomonal antibiotics should then be given first. If there is no apparent clinical response, opportunistic infections like fungal infection should be excluded. If fever is accompanied by obvious respiratory deterioration in the absence of superimposed pulmonary or systemic infection, most patients can be presumed to be suffering from a severe recrudescence of the SARS illness. In such critically ill SARS patients, further escalation of immunomodulation is warranted. Such deterioration could sometimes occur very rapidly; immediate administration of pulsed methylprednisolone therapy at 500–1000 mg per day intravenously for 2 days, followed by tapering doses in the subsequent weeks, has been associated with improved outcome 11,34. Up to one-third to one-half of critically ill SARS patients may benefit from this strategy 4,33,34. Because radiographic abnormalities may lag behind clinical improvement, persistent radiographic shadows per se
, when accompanied by clinical improvement, do not warrant additional corticosteroids 36. 
Human gamma immunoglobulins have been used in selected SARS patients who continued to deteriorate despite treatment 29,33. An IgM-enriched immunoglobulin product (Pentaglobin®, Biotest Pharma GmbH, Germany) has been used in Hong Kong and mainland China 29,35,37. Pentaglobin at 5mg/kg/day for three days given to 12 patients who deteriorated despite repeated rescue methylprednisolone and ribavirin therapy had shown some improvement in radiographic scores and oxygen requirement 38. It has been reported that the use of combined methylprednisolone and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4g/kg) daily for three consecutive days in 15 probable SARS patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS had resulted in lower mortality and a trend towards earlier recovery 39. Randomized controlled trials in larger numbers of patients are required to confirm its efficacy.
Based on the assumption that the neutralizing immunoglobulins in convalescent plasma can curb increases in viral load, convalescent plasma collected from recovered SARS patients has been used in Hong Kong to treat severely ill patients not responding to corticosteroids. Some clinical benefits were reportedly observed in a small number of patients 40.
NIV delivers continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level pressure support through a tight-fitting facial or nasal mask. It was commonly employed in many Chinese hospitals 29,31,37,41,42 and our own centre in Hong Kong 11,43,44. Early application may be beneficial because it could rapidly improve vital signs, oxygenation and tachypnoea 41,43, and may reduce the need for increasing dosages of corticosteroids for progressive respiratory failure. It could avoid intubation and invasive ventilation in up to two-thirds of critically ill SARS patients 29,32,43. Use of NIV in immunocompromised subjects of other diseases has reported similarly reduced rates of endotracheal intubation and serious complications 45. NIV in SARS may be of particular benefit, since high dose corticosteroids per se would already predispose to ventilator-associated pneumonia, and risks to healthcare workers (HCW) could also be markedly reduced through obviating the need for intubation, a potentially highly infectious procedure. Patients who respond to NIV will usually do so within 24 hours, non-responders who will eventually need endotracheal intubation can thus be identified early 43.
NIV is indicated in the presence of ALI and early ARDS when oxygen saturation (SpO2) could not improve to more than 93% despite >5 litres per minute of oxygen; persistent tachypnoea of at least 30 breaths per minute; and progressive radiographic deterioration in the lungs 43. The usual contraindications to NIV apply, including impaired consciousness, uncooperative patient, high aspiration risk, and haemodynamic instability 35. SARS-related respiratory failure responds readily to NIV given at low pressures. CPAP of 4-10 cm H2O, or bi-level pressure support with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of <10 cm H2O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) of 4-6 cm H2O are reasonable starting pressures 43. Higher pressures should be avoided whenever possible, because it may increase the risk of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, which are frequently spontaneous complications of SARS even without assisted positive pressure ventilation 5. 
When patients do not improve within one to two days of NIV or continue to deteriorate, or if NIV is contraindicated, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation should be considered. Most centres 64 adopted a ventilatory strategy similar to that recommended for ARDS from other causes 46. Both pressure and volume control ventilation may be employed 64. The tidal volume should be kept low (e.g. 5-6 ml/Kg predicted body weight), and plateau pressures maintained below 30 cm H2O. Because of a higher risk of barotraumas in SARS, the lowest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) which could achieve satisfactory alveolar recruitment and oxygenation, usually 5-6 cm water, should be employed. Other adjunctive measures employed in the usual ARDS cases had been tried in SARS, including: prone positioning 64,47, high frequency oscillatory ventilation 64,47, nitric oxide 47, high PEEP and regular lung recruitment 64, but their efficacy is uncertain.
Tracheostomy is required in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Strict adherence to infection control guidelines is mandatory in performing tracheostomy in the ICU or operating room, as well as during subsequent changes of the tracheostomy tube 48,49.
Critically ill SARS patients on high dose corticosteroids and mechanical ventilation are particularly susceptible to superimposed bacterial and opportunistic infections. Their peripheral blood CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ were also lower than normal 8,24. Ventilator-associated infection with organisms like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumanii, as well as invasive mucor sp 50 and aspergillosis 50,51 have been reported. Strict control of hyperglycaemia during corticosteroid administration is essential to reduce the chance of septic complications 52.
Spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum are common complications that are potentially aggravated by noninvasive or invasive ventilation 5. While chest drain insertion is useful to relieve pneumothoraces, prolonged air leak may sometimes occur. By itself, SARS predominantly results in single organ failure of the lungs. Other complications reported are more likely the result of sepsis and its attending problems, including acute renal failure (6%), acute liver failure (1%), rhadomyolysis, cardiovascular dysfunction, or of prolonged immobilization and underlying co-morbidities, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, ischaemic strokes, etc 53. 
The case-fatality ratio (CFR) of SARS has been estimated to range from 0% to >50% depending on the age group affected. The overall CFR is approximately 15% 54. Variability may be due to different host and viral factors as well as treatment strategies. CFR may also be significantly affected by the duration of follow-up and inclusion of different mixes of suspected, probable and laboratory confirmed cases in different series 55. 
Based on the treatment principles presented above, we have developed a standard treatment protocol early on in the outbreak, comprising initially high (but not pulsed) dose methylprednisolone with tapering over three weeks 11. This protocol was eventually applied to 88 consecutively admitted SARS patients 56. Their mean age was 42 years, with 97% having laboratory-confirmed SARS. A low overall mortality of 3.4% (3/88) was obtained, with all three deaths occurring in patients over the age of 65 years. Twenty four percent required ICU admission: 14% received NIV (bi-level pressure support) alone and 10% had both NIV and invasive mechanical ventilation. HRCT thorax in all survivors taken 50 days after commencement of treatment showed most did not have clinically significant lung scarring. Another multi-centered study comparing four treatment regimens in Guangzhou, China, also found that a regimen of high dose corticosteroids adjusted according to clinical and radiological severity, coupled with nasal CPAP ventilation, produced the best result: zero mortality in all 60 clinically-defined SARS patients, mean age 30.5 years. With 40% treated with CPAP and none requiring mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, very low mortality was again recorded among a further 160 patients treated with the same regimen 29. 
Many prognostic factors have been reported to independently predict adverse outcome in SARS. They include advanced age 4,57,58,59, diabetes 5,13,59, heart disease 5,59, other significant coexisting conditions 53,59,60, shortness of breath on admission 60, degree of hypoxaemia 58, high total leukocyte count on admission 4,12,60, high initial lactate dehydrogenase 4,57,58, low platelet counts 58, and use of pulsed doses of corticosteroid 4,60. Compared to patients with nasopharyngeal aspirates negative for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR, PCR-positive ones are more likely to require ICU care and mechanical ventilation, develop acute renal failure and die 60. In particular, mortality was high among ICU patients: 28-day ICU mortality was variously reported to be 26-37% 42,64,65. Older age, severity of illness, lymphocyte count, decreased steroid dose, positive fluid balance, chronic disease or immunosuppression, and nosocomial sepsis were associated with poor ICU outcome 65. Patients who had diarrhoea were more likely to require ventilatory support and ICU care 60. Higher serum SARS-CoV concentration in the early stage of the disease was a prognostic indicator for later ICU admission 62. Patients presenting with more extensive radiographic involvement also predicted the need for ICU care or death 63. Age alone is a consistent and strong prognostic factor in all series. Age-stratified death rates were estimated to be <1% in patients below 24 years of age, 6% between 25 and 44 years, 15% between 45 and 64 years, and >50% in elderly patients over 65 years old 66. Corresponding estimates in Hong Kong were 13% in those below 60 years of age, and 43% in those over 60 years 67. 
The cause of death in SARS is usually progressive respiratory failure with or without concomitant sepsis. Sudden cardiac arrest is also possible, and has been hypothesized to be due to hypoxemia (which would worsen during activities including defaecation), direct viral myocardial injury and extreme anxiety, all of which may lead to electrical instability in the myocardium and induction of arrhythmia 68.
SARS is primarily transmitted by direct or indirect contact of mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth) with infectious respiratory droplets or fomites 12,69. Transmission risks increase with duration and proximity of contact. Infection control precautions in the ICU are shown in Appendix 70.
Endotracheal intubation should be considered earlier and in anticipation of impending deterioration, so that ample time is available for preparation. It should be performed by the most skilful airway practitioner in a negative-pressure room behind closed doors. Should the operator choose to wear additional personal protective equipment like the Airmate HEPA Powered Air Purifying Respirator System (3M, MN, USA), he/she must be familiar with its mode of operation and the precautions required for gowning and degowning, and must be assisted by a colleague with similar knowledge 11. A “modified awake” intubation technique has been suggested as the best possible compromise between patient and operator safety by administration of a combination of midazolam, fentanyl and lidocaine until the patient reaches the desired level of sedation 71. The patient is then paralysed after intubation to minimize coughing. Alternatively, the “rapid sequence induction” technique with intravenous administration of midazolam and suxamethonium can also minimize patient coughing. It should however be emphasized that, unless there is prior preparation for a surgical airway, neuromuscular paralysis should be avoided in anticipated difficult intubation in order to maintain spontaneous respiration 71. Both bronchoscopy and NIV should be performed in a negative pressure room. Although there is widespread fear of infective risk by NIV 6,55, centres with such experience, including ours, have found that its use is safe if the necessary precautions are taken 11,29,42,43.
Finally, strict adherence to infection control measures in the form of strict isolation and effective cohorting, early diagnosis and contact tracing, timely reporting and institution of public health measures, as well as enhancement of environmental ventilation is key components in the effective management of infectious diseases. 
Managing critically ill SARS patients is a challenging task. Most, if not all, knowledge about the clinical aspects of SARS are based on retrospective observational data, and randomized-controlled trials are required for confirmation. Physicians and scientists all over the world should collaborate to study this condition which may potentially threaten human existence.

10. Species-independent detection of RNA virus by representational difference analysis using non-ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription
Identifying the causative agent of an infectious disease is the cornerstone for its eventual control. For example, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was controlled after the identification of the causative agent coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1). Developments in molecular biological approaches in recent years have led to the identification of many unknown pathogens. Once a fragment from the agent's genome has been isolated and sequenced, standard genomic walking techniques are used to extend the known sequence, and computer homology searches can then be used to identify the likely phylogenetic relationship of the agent with other known organisms (2). Additionally, sequences of some viruses, such as SARS-CoV, have altered during transmission, and this may prevent the detection of the virus by a PCR method (3,4). Thus, a detection method that is not based on the known sequence is essentially required as an alternative method to the normal PCR method.
Representational difference analysis (RDA) is one of the most reliable methods for identifying new agents since it does not require prior knowledge of the agent's class (5). The technique is based on PCR enrichment of DNA fragments that are present in agent-infected cells but absent in normal cells. Using RDA, Chang et al. (6) isolated two DNA fragments from a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesion in an AIDS patient. The determination of sequences of these fragments resulted in the discovery of the KS-associated herpes virus (7). Despite the fact that RDA has been developed for detecting agents with a DNA-based genome, it can be used to detect the presence or absence of RNA in a sample by generating a cDNA intermediate (cDNA RDA) to amplify the RNA (8). Since a large quantity of ribosomal RNAs interfere with cDNA RDA, the cDNA intermediate should be synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA. Therefore, it is difficult to detect RNA viruses from virus-infected cells by cDNA RDA because many viruses have no poly(A) at the end of the genome. If cDNA RDA can be applied to total RNA without interference with ribosomal RNAs, the virus genome can be amplified from total RNA of virus-infected cells by cDNA RDA.
The selection of poly(A)+ RNA by using an oligo(dT) column followed by oligo(dT) priming can eliminate the influence of ribosomal RNAs on cDNA synthesis. Primers that are specific to a viral genome also efficiently eliminate the influence of ribosomal RNAs. However, prior knowledge of the virus genome is required for the construction of specific primers. In this study, based on the fact that cDNA can be primed with a mixture of oligomers, we constructed a set of oligomers that was inefficient for priming ribosomal RNAs but that normally primed most of the genome of an RNA virus (9,10). Based on the frequency distribution of hexanucleotides in ribosomal RNAs and viral sequences in current public databases, we determined a mixture of 96 hexanucleotides that rarely prime ribosomal RNAs but can prime all the known mammalian viruses listed in public databases. The results of this study show that species-independent detection of viral RNA from infected cells is possible.
A rat primary transcript, including 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNA (V01270.1), was selected for hexanucleotide frequency analysis of ribosomal RNAs. Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV (AY291315) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPI3, NC_002161) were also selected as representatives of RNA virus (11). We created three programs, GREG, GAS and OSC (produced by C's Labs, Sapporo, Japan and licensed by Sigma–Aldrich Co. Ltd, St Louis, MO), connected to a MySQL database server (version 4.0.20). The program GREG transformed FASTA-formatted sequence to a text-formatted sequence and inserted it into a table in the MySQL database (GREG table). Using these programs, we designed a mixture of hexanucleotide primers. First, sequences were divided into hexamers, and each hexamer was classified into a pattern of hexanucleotide sequence in which 46 = 4096 patterns were included. The program GAS generated frequency distributions of hexanucleotides in the sequences in the GREG table, extracted the progeny with their probabilities of hexanucleotide patterns and inserted them into a table (GAS table) of the database. We made four sets of GREG and GAS tables for rat ribosomal RNAs, a satellite repeat, BPI3 and SARS-CoV (Table 1). The program OSC listed the differences between the two GAS tables, i.e. the program selected oligomer patterns that exist in BPI3 but not in ribosomal RNAs. The frequency of hexamer patterns in each RNA sequence was transferred into a table of Microsoft Access. A total of 96 hexamer patterns, including those having very low frequencies or those that did not appear in ribosomal RNAs, were synthesized and mixed for use as an RT primer (Table 2, non-ribosomal hexanucleotides).
To estimate the frequencies of priming sites with the selected hexanucleotides, we prepared a MySQL table that included sequence data of reported viral genomes as follows. First, we downloaded all viral sequences from the FTP site of EMBL database (release date 30 June 2004) and entered them into tables (EMBL data table) of the MySQL database. The table included EMBL ID, title, annotation and sequence as fields. The annotation field included taxonomic classification of the origin of the data. We separated the words included in the annotation field into taxonomic words, such as family names, and inserted them into a new table (taxonomic table), in which EMBL IDs and taxonomic words were included. We then selected EMBL IDs of mammalian viruses with any of the viral family names listed in Table 5 from the taxonomic table. Next, sequences of mammalian viruses were divided into groups according to their species presented in the taxonomic table. To determine the targets for hexanucleotide analysis, EMBL IDs having the longest sequence in the species were selected as the estimated genomic sequence of the virus, and then, a new table named ‘Sequences of viral species’ was prepared. Although the longest sequence from each species was selected, some of these sequences were very short. Therefore, we eliminated sequences that were shorter than half of the common genomic size of each viral family. The resultant 1791 viral sequences were inserted into a table titled ’Genomic sequence of viral species’. The frequency of the non-ribosomal hexanucleotides was determined in sense and complementary strands of the sequences included in the table titled ‘Genomic sequence of viral species’.
The strains SARS-CoV and BPI3 were Frankfurt1 and BN-1, respectively (12–14). SARS-CoV and BPI3 were propagated by serial infection of Vero E6 and MDBK cells, respectively (15).
Vero E6 cells were routinely subcultured in 75 cm2 flasks in DMEM (Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 0.2 mM/ml l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experimental use, the cells were split once in 25 cm2 flasks and cultured until they reached 100% confluence. Prior to the virus infection, the culture medium was replaced with 2% FBS containing DMEM. SARS-CoV, which was isolated as Frankfurt1 and kindly provided by Dr J. Ziebuhr (16), was used in the present study. The viral infection was established in the cells with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 10. The infection of cells with SARS-CoV virus and the subsequent treatment of SARS-CoV RNA were restricted in the P4 area in the National Institute of Infectious Disease, and the work with SARS-CoV was performed in accordance with the rules for infectious pathogens that have been notified by the National Institute of Infectious Disease.
MDBK cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 5% FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. The cells were infected with BPI3 at an m.o.i of 0.1. The work on infection of BPI3 was performed in accordance with the rules for pathogens that have been notified by Rakuno Gakuen University.
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to cDNA synthesis, contaminated genomic DNA in the extracted RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C for 1 h. RNA was extracted serially with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol according to the standard protocol and subsequently used as a control RNA.
For the synthesis of a model RNA, the entire molecule of pCIneo plasmid was transcribed in vitro from a T7 promoter. The synthesized 5.4 kb RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega), extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and subsequently used as a test RNA. After quantitation, the test and control RNAs were mixed to estimate the sensitivity of cDNA RDA in various conditions.
First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the mixed RNA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides by using a double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, i.e. the total RNA was diluted to 1 μg per μl and mixed with dNTPs, the non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, 5× reaction buffer, 0.1 M DTT and an RNase inhibitor. Reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 50°C for 60 min. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), E.coli DNA ligase (Invitrogen) and RNaseH (Invitrogen) at 16°C for 2 h. Double-stranded cDNA was digested with Dpn II, and the resultant fragments were extracted from the digest by using a silicon-membrane-based purification kit (Gene Elute Purification Kit; Sigma–Aldrich).
Linker-derived amplification of DNA fragments and selective amplification steps of cDNA RDA were performed according to the method described by Hubank and Schatz (17). Briefly, 0.1 μg of Dpn II-digested double-stranded cDNA was ligated with RBam24 and RBam12 linkers (5). An aliquot of 1 μl of the ligation solution was diluted with Taq mixture (10 μl of 10× Taq buffer, including 15 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM each of dNTPs). The mixture was preheated to 72°C, and then, Taq polymerase (Promega) was added and the mixture was incubated at 72°C for 5 min to synthesize a complementary strand against the overhanging region of RBam24. This was immediately followed by a denaturation step (94°C for 2 min) and 20 cycles of PCR (94°C for 1 min and 72°C for 8 min) to non-specifically amplify 200–800 bp Dpn II-digested cDNA fragments with linkers (amplicons). After amplification, amplicons were redigested with Dpn II and purified with a silicon-membrane-based purification kit to eliminate the spliced linkers. Some amplicons, including the test RNA, were religated with JBam24 and JBam12 linkers. Amplicons with the second linkers were mixed with a large quantity of amplicons without the test RNA sequences.
The mixture was precipitated with ethanol and 3 M sodium acetate, dissolved in 4 μl of 3× EE buffer {30 mM EPPS [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid], 3 mM EDTA, pH 8.0} and covered with mineral oil. After the mixture was heated to 99°C for 4 min, 1 μl of 5 M NaCl was added, and the solution was incubated at 67°C for 21 h. During this incubation period, amplicons from normal cellular RNA with a linker included in the test amplicons were hybridized with those from uninfected cells without a linker. After hybridization, the reaction mixture was diluted to 100 μl with reaction buffer of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) as described above. Amplicons having the linker sequence at both ends were amplified by a denaturation step (94°C for 2 min) and 20 cycles of PCR (94°C for 1 min and 72°C for 3 min).
RNAs extracted from virus-infected cells were subjected to cDNA RDA as described above, by using amplicons synthesized from RNA obtained from uninfected cells.
cDNA RDA-derived fragments in quantities ranging from 100 ng to 2 μg were separated on agarose gels, blotted onto a Biodyne nylon membrane (Pall Co. Ltd, Port Washington, NY) by capillary transfer in 20× SSC (3 M sodium chloride and 0.3 M sodium citrate) for 16 h and fixed to the membrane by baking in an oven at 80°C for 30 min. pCIneo was used as a probe for the in vitro synthesized RNA. A random primer labelling kit (BcaBest Labeling kit, Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) was used for labelling with 32P and hybridized in SuperHybPlus hybridization solution (Sigma–Aldrich) according to the manufacturers' protocol.
Although amplicons are cloned into a vector to identify its sequence, according to ‘Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety Text of the Protocol’, amplicons from SARS-CoV-infected cells should not be cloned into any plasmid. Therefore, by performing hybridization, we identified that the sequences of amplicons derived from SARS-CoV-infected cells were identical to SARS-CoV. To determine probes for SARS-CoV, the PCR products predicted from the genomic sequence and sizes of cDNA RDA products were amplified from the SARS-CoV genome. These PCR products were purified, labelled with DIG and independently hybridized using a slit of the nylon membrane blotted with amplicons derived from SARS-CoV-infected cells. DIG labelling and hybridization were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions provided with the DIG-hybridization kit (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Diagnostics Division, Basel, Switzerland). Hybridization was carried out with DIG-labelled DNA probes at 65°C for 16 h in DIG-hybridization solution.
The cDNA RDA-derived fragments were respliced with Dpn II, separated on agarose gels, extracted with a silicon-membrane-based purification kit and cloned into pSPORT1 (Invitrogen). Plasmids that included cDNA RDA-derived fragments were selected by colony PCR and purified with a silicon-membrane-based purification kit. Three clones of the plasmid were sequenced along with the fragment to detect PCR errors. Sequences of the cDNA RDA-derived fragments were determined using a DYEnamic ET-terminator kit (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) and an ABI Prism 310 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc., Boston, MA) with M13 forward and reverse primers (Takara Shuzo). We used the BLAST program on NCBI to determine sequences that were homologous to the isolated fragments.
To predict the major RNA molecule in cellular RNA, we synthesized cDNA from RNA extracted from normal bovine cells, synthesized amplicons by using random primers, spliced them with Dpn II and finally subcloned them into pSPORT1. Among the sequences of 30 selected clones, the sequences of 25 clones and 5 clones were highly homologous to those of ribosomal RNA and a 1399 bp satellite repeat (GenBank accession no. V00125), respectively. Based on this result, ribosomal and satellite sequences were determined for analysing hexanucleotide frequency. Since the reported ribosomal sequences of mammals are highly homologous to each other, we selected rat premature 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal sequences as ribosomal sequences for hexanucleotide frequency analysis. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV and BPI3 were selected as representatives of RNA viral sequence. Table 1 shows the probabilities [number of the patterns/(length of sequence × 2)] of hexanucleotides in the human ribosomal RNA, V00125 satellite repeat, BPI3 and SARS-CoV. If a random sequence is assumed, frequencies would be distributed according to the Poisson's distribution, and the average of frequency would be the same as the variance of frequency. Although the average/variance ratios of all the four sequences were <1, the ratio of ribosomal RNA was smallest in these sequences (Table 3). This value suggests that the probabilities of hexamer patterns of ribosomal RNA were strongly biased from random sequence. Based on histograms of probabilities, the distribution of the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA differed greatly from those of V00125 satellite repeat or BPI3 (Figure 1). It should be noted that 8 hexanucleotides did not exist and over 90 hexanucleotides were rare in the ribosomal sequence. To determine primer sequences that do not prime ribosomal RNA but prime viral RNA, the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA and satellite repeat were calculated. The hexamer patterns were then realigned in an ascending order according to the sum of probabilities, and the 1st to 96th patterns were selected as non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, i.e. we selected 96 rarest hexanucleotide patterns (Table 2, non-ribosomal hexanucleotides) in major transcripts in normal mammalian cells on the assumption that ribosomal RNA and transcripts from satellites are the most frequent transcripts in normal cells.
The rarity of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in comparison with non-V00125-satellite and random hexamers was confirmed in reported sequences of mammalian ribosomal RNAs (Table 4). The probabilities were relatively low in all the mammalian ribosomal sequences reported in GenBank. It is considered that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides inefficiently primed ribosomal RNAs in reverse transcription. On the other hand, the probabilities of non-ribosomal, non-V00125-satellite or random hexamers were different among the satellite sequences.
In addition to the inefficiency to prime ribosomal RNAs, efficient priming of V00125-satellite-repeat and BPI3 with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides is shown in Figure 1. To predict priming efficiency in many viruses, the probability of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in known viral genomes was estimated. In 1791 viral sequences in ‘Genomic sequences of viral species’, the median probabilities of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides of all known viral sequences is 13.2–37.6 × 10−3 (Table 5). When the average probabilities were calculated in viral families, the minimum probability was 3.7 × 10−3 in Herpesviridae and the maximum probability was 44.8 × 10−3 in Poxviridae (Table 5). These median values of probabilities in viral genomes were greater than those of ribosomal RNAs (Table 4) and comparable with those of non-V00125 and random hexamers (Table 5). These data suggest that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides prime cDNA synthesis in most viruses.
The database analysis suggests that viral RNAs were efficiently primed by non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in comparison with ribosomal RNAs. We investigated the effect of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides on cDNA synthesis by using in vitro synthesized plasmid RNA (artificial RNA) and total cellular RNA, including ribosomal RNAs. An autoradiogram of 32P-labelled double-stranded cDNAs that were synthesized using non-ribosomal hexanucleotides or a random primer and subsequently separated by agarose gel electrophoresis is shown in Figure 2. When test and total cellular RNAs were reverse transcribed individually, the efficiencies of cDNA synthesis from artificial RNA using random and non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were almost similar; however, the efficiency of cDNA synthesis of cellular RNA was markedly lower in a non-ribosomal hexanucleotide-primed cDNA sample than in a random primer-primed cDNA sample (Figure 2A). In the mixed samples of test and total cellular RNAs, ribosomal RNAs were inefficiently reverse transcribed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. The total incorporated counts in non-ribosomal hexanucleotides-primed cDNAs decreased with a decrease in the proportion of the test RNA in the mixed RNA samples (Figure 2A). It is considered that the efficiency of reverse transcription depends on the proportions of the test RNA in the mixed RNAs. When approximately the same counts of cDNAs were loaded on the gel, synthesis of ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA (ribosomal cDNA) was obvious in random primer-primed cDNAs (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the synthesis of ribosomal cDNA was not obvious in the cDNA primed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. A relatively large cDNA derived from artificial RNA could be observed even when a smaller proportion of test RNA was mixed with cellular RNA and non-ribosomal hexanucleotide-primed samples. These data suggest that the relative amount of test RNA-derived cDNA is greater in non-ribosomal hexanucleotides-primed samples than in random primer-primed samples.
After the first round of cDNA RDA, amplified fragments were observed on agarose by staining with ethidium bromide. The bands that corresponded to artificial RNA could be observed in 1:0, 1:1 and 1:10 (test:total cellular RNAs) mixtures when cDNAs were primed with a random primer. On the other hand, these bands could be observed in 1:0 to 1:300 RNA mixtures when cDNA was primed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides (Figure 3A). This amplification of test RNA was confirmed by hybridization with pCIneo, which was a template for in vitro RNA synthesis (Figure 3B). The hybridized bands were observed even in a lane corresponding to 1:1000 RNA mixture. When cDNA was primed with a random primer, the hybridized bands could not be observed in 1:100, 1:300 and 1:1000 RNA mixtures. These data suggest that the lower limit of the test RNA amplification decreased at least 30 times when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used for reverse transcription when compared with the data obtained by using a random primer.
To amplify virus sequence from infected cells, we subtracted amplicons derived from uninfected cells from those derived from virus-infected cells. Amplicons with linkers derived from the infected cells were mixed with amplicons without linkers derived from uninfected cells at the ratio of 1:100 before a hybridization step of cDNA RDA. At the end of the first round of cDNA RDA, the ladders of amplified fragments were generated from BPI3-infected cells when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used (Figure 4). No cDNA RDA-derived bands were obvious when a random primer was used for reverse transcription (data not shown). Amplified fragments from cDNA RDA of BPI3-infected cells were cloned into pSPORT1 plasmid, and the sequences were determined. The sequences of all the cloned fragments from cDNA RDA were identical to the sequence of the BPI3 genome. These data suggest that cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides enables the identification of the BPI3 genome sequence from infected cells.
Similar to BPI3, cDNA fragments derived from SARS-CoV were also amplified from SARS-CoV-infected cells (Figure 5). Viral origin of the amplified fragments was confirmed by hybridization (Figure 5B) and PCR amplification by SARS-CoV-specific primers (Figure 5A). These results indicate that genomic fragments of SARS-CoV can also be isolated by this method.
It is well known that 3–5% and 30% of cellular RNA are estimated to be messenger and ribosomal RNA, respectively. The frequency of ribosomal RNA has been estimated by competitive PCR and real-time PCR to be 10 000 copies per cell (18). The amount of ribosomal RNA has been reported to be 1000-fold greater than that of frequently transcribed mRNA, such as beta actin and G6PDH. Thus, the repertoire of cDNA would be strongly affected by ribosomal RNA. This influence of ribosomal RNA has been avoided by oligo(dT) selection. Alternative strategy for the elimination of ribosomal RNA from total RNA, however, has not been developed. Therefore, there have been only a few applications of cDNA RDA for non-poly(A) RNA, such as those in viral genomes. In this study, we developed a new strategy for the elimination of ribosomal RNA in cDNA RDA through the construction of a hexanucleotide mixture and demonstrated its efficiency in cDNA RDA.
The main purpose of PCR is specific amplification of a gene. However, methods using multiple primers for simultaneous gene amplification have been recently employed for DNA chip methods. In order to simultaneously detect multiple genes by using a DNA chip, mixed oligonucleotides have been used as a primer for reverse transcription. This usage of mixed primers was based on the assumption that the specificity of primers was equal to the summation of the specificity of each primer. Thus, we searched for primers that do not prime ribosomal RNAs by frequency analysis of hexanucleotides. The frequency and distribution of oligonucleotides in mammalian and viral genomes have been studied to search for common motifs that might be used for controlling cellular functions (19–23). Volinia et al. (22) found sets of common decamers that can be used for the control of transcription control signals or for the common amplification of viruses. Programs for frequency analysis have been useful for searching common oligonucleotides in many subsets of sequences. On the other hand, database programming is useful not only for searching common oligonucleotides but also for searching oligonucleotides that do not exist in a subset of sequences. In this study, we found that there were hexanucleotide patterns that were rare or that did not exist in ribosomal RNA sequences. We also showed that sequences of 96 selected non-ribosomal hexanucleotides are normally present in known viral sequences (Table 5).
In the experiment for the determination of the effect of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, we used a mixture of artificially synthesized and total cellular RNAs. The probabilities of hexanucleotide patterns in the sequence of pCIneo was different from ribosomal RNA (18.4 × 10−3, 22.4 × 10−3 and 23.0 × 10−3 for non-ribosomal, non-V00125 and random hexamers, respectively). The artificially synthesized RNA included 30 priming sites for non-ribosomal hexanucleotides and was efficiently reverse transcribed (Figure 2). In the model experiments, cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides efficiently reverse transcribed and specifically amplified the extracellular test RNA in the mixed RNA (Figure 3). cDNA RDA-derived detection of the artificial RNA was 30-fold more sensitive when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used than when random hexamers were used. These results suggest that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides dramatically improve the detection efficiency of cDNA RDA.
The common existence of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in known viral genomes (Table 5) and the improved sensitivity for the amplification of a non-ribosomal sequence in the mixed RNAs (Figure 3) suggest that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides could be used for non-specific detection of a viral sequence in infected cells. However, the sensitivity for sequence detection may be low when compared with that of common PCR using specific primers. Thus, the usage of this method might be restricted to infected cells that contain many copies of a virus.
The copy number of RNA viruses is dependent on the virus species, host cells and replicative and productive state of viruses. In our experiment, we detected 3 ng of contaminated RNAs in 1 μg of total RNA. Although this sensitivity is considerably lower than that of normal PCR, our experiments on SARS-CoV and BPI3 suggest that the sensitivity of cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides is sufficient to detect these viruses in productively infected cells. Additionally, this method can be applied to most productive viruses, since sense and complementary sequences of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were found to exist in most of the known virus sequences in GenBank (Table 5). In conclusion, this method could be applied as an alternative method for the detection of any emerging viruses.

11. Factors affecting translation at the programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting site of Cocksfoot mottle virus RNA in vivo
The principal mechanism of translation is the accurate decoding of the triplet codon sequences in one reading frame of mRNA. Specific signals built into the mRNA sequences can cause deviations from this rule. Viruses exploit several translational ‘recoding’ mechanisms, including translational hopping, stop codon readthrough and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) [reviewed in (1,2)], for regulating the amount of proteins produced from their polyproteins. For positive-stranded RNA viruses, −1 PRF is the prevailing recoding mechanism and an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral proteins. Most viral −1 PRF signals are regulating the production of replication-associated proteins. Depending on the virus, the efficiency of −1 PRF can vary between 1 and 40% (3), and changes in the efficiency can inhibit virus assembly and replication (4–6). Therefore, −1 PRF can be regarded as a potential target for antiviral agents (4,7). However, the development of efficient antiviral drugs is still hindered, since little is known about the trans-acting factors and the biophysical parameters affecting the −1 PRF efficiencies. Database searches have identified putative frameshift signals from a substantial number of chromosomally encoded eukaryotic mRNAs (8). Thus, −1 PRF may also have an impact on the complexity of the proteome of several eukaryotic organisms.
Two cis-acting signals, a slippery heptamer X XXY YYZ (the incoming reading frame indicated) and a downstream secondary structure, direct the slippage and are therefore essential for this event (9). −1 PRF takes place after the accommodation step in the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of both tRNAs into the overlapping −1 frame XXX YYY (9,10). The sequence of the heptamer allows post-slippage base-pairing between the non-wobble bases of the tRNAs and the new −1 frame codons of the mRNA. Downstream RNA secondary structures [reviewed in (11)] force the ribosomes to pause, and place the ribosomal A- and P-sites correctly over the slippery sequence (12). However, the pausing of the ribosomes is not sufficient for −1 PRF to occur (13); in fact, the duration of the halt does not necessarily correlate with the level of the −1 PRF observed (12). Crystallographic, molecular, biochemical and genetic studies suggest that a pseudoknot restricts the movement of the mRNA during the tRNA accommodation step of elongation by filling the entrance of the ribosomal mRNA tunnel (14). This restriction can be eased either by unwinding the pseudoknot, which allows the mRNA to move forward, or by a slippage of the mRNA one nucleotide backwards. Chemical agents such as antibiotics, certain mutations in the translation apparatus, and in translation elongation factors that change the translation fidelity and kinetics, have been shown to influence −1 PRF efficiency [(10,15); reviewed in (16)].
The parameters known to contribute to the efficiency of −1 PRF are the sequence of the slippery heptamer, the downstream secondary structure, and the length and sequence of the spacer between the two cis-acting signals. Up- and downstream sequences such as termination codons in the vicinity of the −1 PRF signals, or even several kilobases away from them, can affect the −1 PRF efficiencies (3,17–22). A specific sequence in the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) 3′ untranslated region (UTR), 4 kb downstream from the slippage site, is vital for −1 PRF (6,19). A stimulating effect is achieved through the formation of a tertiary structure, where complementary nucleotides from the 3′ UTR base pair with a single-stranded bulge in the cis-acting stem–loop (6). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was also shown to require a more complex secondary structure instead of a simple stem–loop for optimal −1 PRF in vivo (21,22). These investigations suggest that −1 PRF studies carried out with minimal frameshift signals may lead to inaccurate estimates of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral protein products during infection.
Cocksfoot mottle virus (CfMV; genus Sobemovirus) infects a few monocotyledonous plant species such as barley, oats and wheat. It has a monopartite, single-stranded, 4082 nt long, positive-sense RNA genome (23,24). The polyprotein of CfMV is translated from two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) 2A and 2B by a −1 PRF mechanism (25). In this study, we wanted to determine the in vivo −1 PRF efficiency guided by the CfMV U UUA AAC heptamer and the stem–loop structure. In addition to the minimal signal (18), we decided to test the effect of flanking CfMV sequences for their ability to contribute to −1 PRF. We found that the surrounding viral sequences promoted more efficient −1 PRF than the minimal signal sequence in vivo when measured with the dual reporter vector system developed by Stahl et al. (26). Therefore, we carried out an expression pattern and deletion analysis to understand the molecular basis of the observed upregulation. In addition, we critically analysed the suitability of the implemented experimental system for this type of a recoding study. An interesting possibility is that the viral proteins produced via −1 PRF could regulate −1 PRF. This hypothesis was tested by co-expressing the CfMV proteins P27 and replicase together with the dual reporter vectors.
Three regions from the CfMV polyprotein ORFs (Figure 1A) were cloned into the NheI and BclI sites between the lacZ and the luc ORFs in pAC74 (26). This dual reporter vector was a generous gift from Dr J. Rousset of the Universite Paris-Sud, France. The inserted sequences 1602–1720 (A region), 1386–2137 (B region) and 1551–1900 (C region), were amplified by PCR using pAB-21 as a template (18). Primers were used to introduce NheI and BglII sites to the flanking ends of the inserts. Since NheI digestion removed lacZ ORF, it was reintroduced into the plasmids as a final cloning step. The resulting plasmids were named pAC-A, pAC-B and pAC-C. Corresponding inframe controls, where one nucleotide was added in front of the slippery heptamer, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (Exsite, Stratagene) and named as pAC-Am, pAC-Bm and pAC-Cm, respectively. Deletion plasmids pAC-AB/ABm (1602–2137), pAC-AC/ACm (1602–1900), pAC-BA/BAm (1386–1720) and pAC-CA/CAm (1551–1720) were also generated. The target sequences are shown in Figure 1B. The base numbering refers to the CfMV genome as in (23). Transcription was driven from SV40 promoter. Plasmids encoded leucine (LEU2) and β-lactamase (ampicillin resistance) as selective markers. Plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae H23 [MATα hsp150::URA3 ura3-1 his3-11 15leu2-3 112trp1-1 ade2-1 can100]. Dual reporter plasmid pAC1789 and the inframe control pAC1790 containing a 53 bp sequence from the HIV-1 frameshift region (26) were used as a positive control for monitoring the −1 PRF efficiency.
To analyse the proteins produced during −1 PRF, lacZ-A/Am/B/Bm/C/Cm-Fluc fragments were cloned inframe with the N-terminal 6xhistidine-tag in pYES2/NT KpnI and XhoI sites (Invitrogen). Reporter fusions were amplified by PCR using pAC-A/Am, pAC-B/Bm or pAC-C/Cm as templates. The resulting plasmids were named pYES2/NT-A/Am, B/Bm and C/Cm. Protein expression was regulated from GAL1 promoter. Two CfMV encoded proteins, P27 (C-terminal end of ORF2A) and replicase (ORF2B), were cloned into pYES2 (Invitrogen). Translation initiation codons were introduced within the oligonucleotides during PCR. The resulting plasmids were named pYES-P27 and pYES-Rep. Control plasmids, which lacked the translation initiation codons were prepared by PCR-based mutagenesis (pYES-P27ΔAUG and pYES-RepΔAUG) and the resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing. Plasmids encoded auxotrophic marker for uracil (URA3).
All cloning steps were performed using standard protocols. Plasmids were amplified either in Escherichia coli DH5α or JM110, and purified with Qiagen columns. Inserts were verified by sequencing. Yeast transformations were done using the LiAc method (27), and transformants were selected on a synthetic minimal defined medium (SC) lacking the corresponding auxotrophic marker(s) encoded by the used plasmid(s). Bacteria (E.coli DH5α) were grown in LB-medium containing ampicillin, whereas yeast cells were grown either in YPD, or in an SC medium. Protein expression from GAL1 promoter was repressed during growth at SC medium containing 2% glucose. Expression was induced by replacing glucose with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose.
Reporter fusions were expressed in S.cerevisiae INVSc1 (his3Δ1/his3Δ1, leu2/leu2 trp1-289/trp1-289 ura3-52/ura3-52) (Invitrogen) overnight. Protein fusions were purified in denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), and analysed in 6% SDS–PAGE gels. Proteins were visualized either by Coomassie staining, or by using antisera raised against the CfMV polyprotein region 1386–1724 encoding CfMV VPg (28). Protein antibody complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) and ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham).
Plasmids pYES-P27, pYES-Rep, pYES-P27ΔAUG, pYES-RepΔAUG, or empty pYES2 were co-expressed with pAC-A or with the corresponding pAC-Am inframe control in S.cerevisiae EGY48 strain (MATα, ura3, trp1, his3, 6lexAop-LEU2) (Invitrogen). Transformants were grown overnight in SC-Leu-Ura media in non-inducing conditions, and used to inoculate induction medium. Cells were harvested at late logarithmic phase. Expression of the CfMV proteins was confirmed by western blotting using polyclonal antisera against the CfMV ORF 2a and 2b proteins (28). Determining the enzymatic activities as described below monitored the effect of CfMV P27 and replicase on −1 PRF.
For the in vitro analysis, the lacZ-gene of pAC-A/Am, -B/Bm and -C/Cm vectors was replaced with PCR-amplified Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene from pRLnull vector (Promega). The resulting pACRF plasmids were used as templates for PCR in order to add T7 promoter upstream of the Rluc gene. These PCR products were used for RNA synthesis with RiboMax kit (Promega). Transcripts were treated with RQ1-DNase (Promega), purified with Qiagen RNeasy columns, and quantified spectrophotometrically. The integrity of the transcripts was checked in agarose gels. In vitro translations were carried out in wheat germ extract (WGE) according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). Reactions were incubated in room temperature for 60 min, and stopped on ice prior to enzymatic measurements.
Cell cultures were started from at least three independent clones and grown until the late exponential phase. Cells were collected by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication (3 × 15 s), and yeasts by vortexing with glass beads (0.5 vol) in +4°C for 30 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and enzymatic activities were determined immediately. Total protein concentrations were measured by using a Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). β-Galactosidase (LacZ) and firefly or Renilla luciferase (LUC or RUC) activities were measured with commercial kits from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. LacZ activity was determined as the colour intensity at A414 nm. Luciferase activities were measured as relative light units (RLUs) with luminometer (Biohit or ThermoLabsystems). −1 PRF efficiencies were calculated from normalized firefly luciferase activities with the following formula: [(LUC activity from the test construct)/(LacZ or RUC activity from the test construct)]/[(LUC activity from the inframe control)/(LacZ or RUC activity from the inframe control)] × 100%.
In CfMV, the motif for −1 PRF is the slippery heptamer U UUA AAC and a stem–loop structure 7 nt downstream (25). The efficiency of −1 PRF directed by CfMV cis-acting signals was assayed in vivo using a dual reporter vector system (Figure 1A). Since reporters are produced from one single mRNA, factors that affect the stability of the mRNA as well as the rate of translation initiation have a similar influence on the expression of both reporters, and these variations can be monitored as changes in the activity of the upstream reporter. We quantified −1 PRF by comparing the β-galactosidase normalized firefly luciferase activities derived from the test constructs via −1 PRF to those obtained from the inframe controls, in which identical β-galactosidase–CfMV–firefly luciferase fusions are produced without −1 PRF due to the added nucleotide in front of the slippery heptamer (see Figure 1A). Similar vectors have been shown to detect even small changes in the recoding efficiencies resulting from alterations in the cis- or trans-acting factors (26,29–32).
Three inserts of varied lengths from the CfMV polyprotein-encoding region (ORF2A/2B) were introduced between the two reporters (Figure 1B). The A-region, which at 119 bp was the shortest, represented approximately the minimal frameshift signal proven to be functional in vitro (18). The longest region was the B-insert. At 752 bp, it started from the 5′-terminus of the 12 kDa viral genome-linked protein (VPg) gene and continued to the end of ORF2A. This region encodes CfMV protein P27 with an unknown function (28). Since the minimal requirements for the functional frameshift signal in vivo were not known, an intermediate 349 bp C-sequence was also selected for the analysis. A well-characterized 53 bp frameshift cassette derived from HIV-1 RNA was used as a positive control. Our results regarding the HIV −1 PRF efficiency, 0.7 ± 0.1% in bacteria, and 4.5 ± 1.1% in yeast (Figure 2), are corroborated by those published earlier (26,33,34) indicating that our dual reporter system was fully functional.
β-Galactosidase has been shown to retain its specific activity well, irrespective of the C-terminal fusions (35). This is important, since the first reporter serves to control the variations among the abundance and translation rates of the studied mRNAs (26,30). In addition to changes in specific activities, heterologous fusions can cause alterations in the solubility and conformation, which can expose cryptic protease target sites and reduce the stability of the proteins (36). Therefore, for a reliable quantification of −1 PRF, it was important to test that equimolar amounts of fusions produced from the corresponding test and control constructs had similar enzymatic activities. Most inframe controls and the analogous test constructs had equal absolute β-galactosidase activities (Table 1). Comparable results were obtained, if activities were normalized with total protein concentration (data not shown). These results indicated that the length of the fusion as such did not affect the specific activities. The β-galactosidase activity from pAC-Am inframe control was also comparable to activity obtained from an empty pAC74, where this enzyme has no fusion (data not shown). This further supported the view that the few observed variations in the β-galactosidase activities more likely resulted from the changes in translatability or stability of the transcripts. In addition to pAC-Cm, two inframe controls pAC-Am and pAC-ACm showed ∼25% lower β-galactosidase activities when compared to the equivalent test constructs (Table 1), indicating that the productivity from these constructs was reduced. Taken together, β-galactosidase seemed to fit well to be used as the first reporter and thus normalization factor in the in vivo experiments of this study.
CfMV frameshift signals generated significant −1 PRF in yeast. −1 PRF level measured from pAC-A was 3-fold higher than from HIV RNA (Figure 2A and B). The extent of −1 PRF directed by the minimal region A in yeast, 14.4 ± 1.9%, was at the same level as that reported for the CfMV minimal frameshift signal in vitro (12.7%) (18). In contrast to our earlier in vitro observations (18), the longer CfMV sequences upregulated −1 PRF in vivo. In yeast, the level of upregulation was 2-fold for pAC-B, the −1 PRF frequency being 26.3%, and almost 5-fold for pAC-C resulting in efficiency close to 70% (Figure 2A), which is an extremely high value, if compared to the other values published earlier (3). CfMV frameshift signals directed −1 PRF at a lower level in bacteria than in yeast (Figure 2B). The extent of −1 PRF directed by region A in bacteria was 2.4 ± 0.7%. As in yeast, the longest B region stimulated −1 PRF 2-fold in bacteria when compared with pAC-A. However, region C did not further improve −1 PRF, but programmed −1 PRF to similar levels as pAC-B, the percentages being 4.7 ± 1.6% for pAC-C and 5.5 ± 1.5% for pAC-B.
To identify the sequence(s) responsible for the enhancement of −1 PRF in vivo, a deletion analysis was carried out. The 5′- or the 3′-sequences flanking the A-region were deleted from pAC-B/Bm or pAC-C/Cm as indicated in Figure 1B, which generated vectors pAC-AB/ABm, pAC-BA/BAm, pAC-AC/ACm and pAC-CA/CAm. −1 PRF frequencies were determined in yeast (Figure 2C). Increased −1 PRF was observed in all deletion constructs in comparison to the −1 PRF directed by the A region. The BA and AB regions promoted −1 PRF as efficiently as the B region, whereas regions CA and AC were better than region A, but not as good as region B. In other words, the presence of nucleotides 1386–1720, or downstream nucleotides 1602–2137, was sufficient to increase −1 PRF to the level directed by the region B. Thus, the deletion analysis did not identify single specific sequence region as being responsible for the increased −1 PRF frequencies.
The expression pattern of the test and control constructs was analysed to understand the basis for the observed upregulation in yeast. Cassettes containing the reporters and the studied intercistronic sequences were expressed and purified as N-terminal histidine fusions. This allowed us to capture all the N-terminally intact products. The affinity-purified proteins were separated in SDS–PAGE gels, and visualized either by Coomassie staining (data not shown), or by western blotting with the CfMV-specific anti-VPg antibodies. The expected β-galactosidase–CfMV fusions terminating at the end of the 0-frame in the test constructs were detected. Also, the longer transframe β-galactosidase–CfMV–firefly luciferase fusion proteins were present in both the test and the inframe constructs (Figure 3). Comparison of the Coomassie-stained gels with the western blots revealed that the antisera recognized the products terminating at the CfMV-encoding regions better than the transframe products. Furthermore, the small size of the CfMV-specific region in the pYES2/NT-Am decreased the binding of the antibodies to these inframe control fusions. Thus, this data were not suitable for quantitative analysis of −1 PRF. Interestingly, an additional protein, which reacted with CfMV-specific antisera, was co-purified from the cells expressing pYES2/NT-Bm and pYES2/NT-Cm inframe controls (Figure 3). The size of these fusions suggested that translation had terminated approximately at the site for −1 PRF signals. If such putative termination products were also present in cells expressing the test constructs, the correctly terminated 0-frame products in the western blots masked these products.
A closer look at the absolute β-galactosidase and firefly luciferase activities revealed that firefly luciferase expression from pAC-Cm was clearly reduced (data not shown). In fact, expression from the inframe control was comparable to the corresponding pAC-C test construct. This was also obvious when the firefly luciferase activities were normalized with the total protein amount. After setting the activity from pAC-Am to a relative value of one, the corresponding values from pAC-Bm and pAC-Cm were 0.80 and 0.28. Although the β-galactosidase measurements (Table 1) suggested that the overall translatability of the pAC-Cm mRNA was also reduced to some extent, it explained the decrease in firefly luciferase expression only partially. In the light of these findings, the extremely high −1 PRF frequency estimate calculated for the C-region could be explained with more frequent translation termination at the frameshift signals of the pAC-Cm mRNA, which reduced firefly luciferase activity in relation to β-galactosidase.
−1 PRF was also assayed in vitro in WGE. Although LacZ-encoding gene is suitable for the in vivo studies, it is an unsuitable first reporter for the in vitro determination of −1 PRF efficiencies due to its big size (30). In good agreement with this, we observed several unexpected products in the in vitro translations programmed with LacZ–CfMV–luc mRNAs (data not shown). Renilla luciferase has been shown to retain its specific activity irrespective of the C-terminal fusions (30). Therefore, we decided to use Rluc–CfMV–luc transcripts to determine the −1 PRF efficiencies in the cell-free system. First, we verified the suitability of Renilla luciferase for the intended in vitro experiments as described in (30). Transcripts encoding monocistronic Renilla luciferase and Renilla luciferase fused to firefly luciferase (Rluc-Am/Cm-luc) were mixed in different ratios and used to program the in vitro translations. Increasing concentrations of transcripts encoding the Rluc-Am-luc fusion resulted in linearly growing firefly luciferase activities. At the same time Renilla luciferase activities remained constant, which showed that its enzymatic activity was not sensitive to the C-terminal fusions (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained with Rluc-Cm-luc mRNA (data not shown). −1 PRF efficiencies were then determined with transcripts that contained CfMV regions A, B and C, and their corresponding inframe controls. In all cases, slightly higher −1 PRF frequencies were obtained than in vivo. In nice correlation with the in vivo results, enhanced −1 PRF was observed with the region B, although the effect was weaker than in vivo. In this context, region C did not differ from the minimal region A in its capacity to program −1 PRF (Figure 4B).
The ratio between the CfMV P27 and replicase is regulated by −1 PRF during CfMV infection (28). We studied whether these proteins could regulate the −1 PRF process. P27, replicase, or an empty expression vector was co-expressed in yeast together with the dual reporter vectors containing the minimal −1 PRF test and inframe control regions as intergenic sequences (pAC-A and -Am). P27 and replicase expression was verified by a western blot analysis (Figure 5). A faint band having nearly the same mobility as the replicase was detected in cells grown under repressing conditions. However, due to the small size difference, this protein was not regarded as replicase.
Enzymatic activities were measured from yeast lysates prepared from induced cultures. Measurements showed comparable levels of β-galactosidase in all the samples, indicating that P27 or replicase expression did not affect the stability of the dual reporter mRNA or the translatability of the first reporter (Table 2). The effect of P27 or replicase expression was monitored by comparing the reporter activity ratios to those measured from cells harbouring the empty expression plasmids (Table 2). Co-expression of CfMV replicase did not affect the normalized firefly luciferase expression (LUC/LacZ) from the inframe control, whereas slightly increased luciferase expression from the test construct was observed. In contrast, P27 expression reduced firefly luciferase expression both from the test and the inframe constructs. The effect was stronger in the presence of inframe control as normalized firefly luciferase levels reached only 54% of expression measured from the empty vector control.
To verify that the observed differences in firefly luciferase production depended on the studied CfMV proteins, we co-expressed the dual reporter vectors with plasmids having the first translation initiation codons of P27 and replicase deleted (pYES-P27ΔAUG and pYES-RepΔAUG). Western blot analysis with antisera against ORF2A or 2B did not detect any proteins produced from these vectors (data not shown). The obtained LUC/LacZ ratios were compared to those measured from cells expressing the CfMV proteins (pYES-P27 or pYES-Rep). LUC/LacZ ratios measured from cells expressing replicase were slightly lower than the ratios calculated from cells harbouring pYES-RepΔAUG plasmids, being ∼90% when co-expressed with pAC-A and ∼84% when co-expressed with pAC-Am. In the presence of P27, LUC/LacZ ratio of pAC-A reached ∼81% of expression measured from cells transformed with pYES-P27ΔAUG. Again the effect of P27 expression was more evident with pAC-Am inframe control as P27 expression reduced LUC/LacZ ratio to half (∼48%) when compared to the corresponding value measured from the cells harbouring pYES-P27ΔAUG. This verified that CfMV P27 was able to reduce the downstream reporter expression from dual reporter mRNAs. Since CfMV P27 had a proportionally stronger effect to firefly luciferase production from the inframe control mRNAs in comparison to the test mRNAs (Table 2), the calculated −1 PRF efficiency increased from 14.7 to 22.4%.
Since −1 PRF studies are affected by a huge number of different parameters, it is not an easy task to determine the real ratio between the proteins produced via this mechanism in vivo. However, in viral systems, the efficiency of −1 PRF is an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral protein products, which must be rigidly maintained for efficient propagation of the virus. For example, frameshifting in retroviruses determines the ratio of structural (Gag) to enzymatic (Gag-Pol) proteins, and plays a critical role in viral particle assembly (5). In this study, the capacity of CfMV frameshift signals to direct efficient −1 PRF was analysed in vivo by using dual reporter vectors. The length of the CfMV sequence clearly affected the actual efficiency percent in vivo. The PRF efficiency was elevated when longer viral sequences were directing the −1 PRF, but the deletion analysis did not identify any specific region as being solely responsible for the enhancement. Up- and downstream sequences nearby or far away from the cis-acting signals have been reported to enhance −1 PRF in other viruses, such as HIV, human T-cell leukaemia virus and BYDV (6,19,20). Also out-of-frame stop codons have been shown to influence −1 PRF frequency in vitro in retroviruses (17) and in CfMV (18). A study on the spacer sequences located between the cis-acting signals showed that high slippage frequencies were obtained when the first three nucleotides were G/U, G/A and G/A, the first two being the most important (37). In CfMV, the spacer starts with UAC, which partially explains the capacity of the CfMV sequence to promote high slippage levels. In this study, the observed enhancement of −1 PRF was, however, caused by sequences that were not in the immediate vicinity of the slippery sequence thus indicating that CfMV sequences further away also have an influence on the level of frameshifting in vivo. We conclude that the most reliable estimates for −1 PRF and consequently for the amount of replicase versus the 0-frame translation product P27 can be obtained only by using the full-length viral sequences. In reality, such a study would however be hampered by the non-quantitative nature of the western blot analysis, the presence of different polyprotein processing intermediates, and the differences in the stabilities of the end products in the infected cells.
The overall competence of CfMV signals to direct −1 PRF was high, when compared to related plant viruses, such as Potato leaf roll virus and BYDV. −1 PRF values of ∼1% have been reported for these viruses when measured with reporter-based assays (6,38). We can hypothesize that one reason for the high efficiency is the slippery tRNAAsn encoding the AAC triplet of the CfMV heptamer. Equal U UUA AAC slippery heptamer has been measured to induce 20–40% of −1 PRF in a diversity of animal viruses [(39); reviewed in (3)]. The low fitness of CfMV −1 PRF signals in bacteria is in agreement with the poor functioning of the eukaryotic slippery heptamers of the order X XXA AAC in prokaryotes (40–42). IBV RNA, having an identical shifty heptamer, has been shown to direct −1 PRF at similar 2–3% level in bacteria (41). A recent study reported that XXXAAAC heptamers dictate −1 PRF to occur via the slippage of two adjacent tRNAs placed over the heptamer, irrespective of whether the host is an eukaryote or a prokaryote (42). Therefore, the inability of prokaryotic translation systems to direct efficient −1 PRF from this heptamer is not an inherited property of prokaryotic tRNAAsn, but results from differences in the ribosomes (42).
Paused ribosomes can pass the −1 PRF site by −1 frameshifting, resumption of 0-frame translation, or termination (43). Transient polypeptide intermediates that result from the pausing of ribosomes in the slippery sequences have been observed during IBV and S.cerevisiae L-A virus polyprotein synthesis (12,13,43,44). A pseudoknot structure formed by IBV mRNA causes a translational pause at fixed position upstream the secondary structure regardless of whether the slippery heptamer is present or absent (12). Based on the findings of this study, we propose that also here a certain percent of ribosomes stalled at the secondary structure of the frameshift site in our inframe control and test mRNAs in yeast, and this led to the prematurely terminated products observed with the inframe control constructs pAC-Bm and -Cm. Although not unambiguously proven by this study, high frequency of termination of translation especially at the frameshift site of the pAC-Cm mRNA would nicely explain the extremely high calculated −1 PRF efficiency.
Factors that change the translation fidelity and kinetics have been shown to influence −1 PRF efficiency [(10,15); reviewed in (16)]. Autoregulation of +1 frameshifting by mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has been reported (45). This mechanism allows modulation of frameshifting frequency according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. One could speculate that such a regulation mechanism could also be useful to adjust the amounts of the replication-associated proteins to match the requirements of different phases in viral replication cycle. This hypothesis was studied by expressing CfMV proteins P27 and replicase together with pAC-A and pAC-Am in yeast cells. Since β-galactosidase production remained constant regardless of the presence or absence of CfMV proteins, they did not interfere with translation initiation from pAC-A/Am mRNAs per se. However, P27 expression caused a reduction in the firefly luciferase production especially from the inframe control, whereas replicase production only slightly increased the firefly luciferase production from pAC-A, but not from pAC-Am. Since replicase expression had only a faint effect on the normalized firefly luciferase production via −1 PRF, our conclusion is that CfMV replicase had no pronounced effect on translation at the frameshift site. Co-expression of the non-translatable form of P27 with the dual reporter vectors verified that P27 truly affected firefly luciferase expression on the protein level. Therefore, we propose that CfMV protein P27 may influence translation at the frameshift site. If CfMV P27 indeed interferes with viral protein synthesis during CfMV infection, the mechanism, its specificity and the possible biological role needs to be elucidated in the future.

12. Subversion of Cellular Autophagosomal Machinery by RNA Viruses
Upon infection by poliovirus and many other positive-strand RNA viruses, dramatic changes are rapidly induced in the cellular environment. Poliovirus infection causes the massive rearrangement of intracellular membranes, with double-membraned vesicles 200–400 nm in diameter accumulating in the cytoplasm [1,2]. Immunoelectron microscopy has revealed that the cytoplasmic surfaces of these membranous vesicles are the sites of viral RNA replication [3,4,5] and, indeed, all known positive-strand RNA viruses of eukaryotic cells replicate their RNA on cytoplasmic membranes. It is thought that one function for membrane localization of viral RNA replication proteins is to promote their oligomerization [6,7].
It has been noted previously that several of the features displayed by the vesicles induced during poliovirus infection [1,2] are known to be shared with cellular membranous structures termed autophagosomes. During cellular autophagy, cells break down cytoplasmic proteins and organelles within autophagosomes, double-membraned structures that become degradative upon maturation. Originally identified as a process induced by cellular starvation, autophagy is now appreciated as a cellular response to a variety of stimuli, including hormone treatment, and is a feature of normal development in several organisms (reviewed in [8]). In mammalian cells, two chemical inducers of autophagy are tamoxifen [9,10] and rapamycin [11,12,13]. Cells that express the estrogen receptor respond to tamoxifen treatment by accumulating large amounts of autophagosomes [9,10]. Rapamycin inhibits the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin, a known repressor of the autophagic pathway (reviewed in [14]). In yeast, formation and maturation of autophagosomes requires the functions of many genes (reviewed in [15]). Human homologs of several of the yeast autophagy genes have been recently identified, including LC3, the human homolog of Atg8p, and it is likely that much of the autophagic pathway is conserved [16,17,18].
In mammalian cells, the formation and maturation of autophagosomes involves the stepwise acquisition of proteins from disparate cellular compartments (reviewed in [19,20,21]). Nascent autophagosomes form either de novo [22,23] or from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [24,25] and comprise cellular cytoplasm surrounded by two lipid bilayers that fuse from a C-shaped intermediate. Although relatively protein-poor [22,26], they have been shown to contain a modified, lipidated form of LC3 [16]. As maturation proceeds, the late autophagosome acquires LAMP1 before lysosomal fusion [16,25,27,28], which defines the “mature autolysosome.” Mature autolysosomes are no longer surrounded by double membranes and, having degraded the inner membrane and much of the cytosolic contents, become electron-dense [27,29]. Various intermediates among these stages have also been visualized, including incompletely fused double membranes and incompletely degraded inner membranes [23,24,25].
Although poliovirus-induced vesicles display several hallmarks of autophagosomes, other origins for the poliovirus-induced vesicles have been suggested [30,31,32]. Poliovirus RNA replication is known to be inhibited by brefeldin A, which has led to the suggestion that the virally induced vesicles might derive from the COPI pathway, a known target of brefeldin A [32,33,34]. However, this would be inconsistent with the apparent origin of the poliovirus-induced vesicles from the ER: many images consistent with the budding of the poliovirus-induced vesicles directly from the ER have been reported [3,31]. Furthermore, poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A induce the formation of vesicles that are biochemically and ultrastructurally similar to those formed in poliovirus-infected cells [35]. The 3A protein and 2C, a proteolytic product of 2BC, localize to the ER when expressed in isolation [35,36]. Therefore, it is likely that poliovirus proteins 3A and 2BC, or larger precursors, localize to the ER early in infection and subsequently promote vesiculation from ER membranes.
Poliovirus-induced vesicles have been shown to contain human COPII proteins Sec13p and Sec31p early in their formation, leading to the hypothesis that they are modified COPII vesicles, subverted from the anterograde transport pathway [31]. Although this is an attractive suggestion, it is incongruent with other findings concerning the poliovirus-induced vesicles: their frequently observed double-membraned morphology, their cytosolic contents, and the abundance of components from throughout the secretory pathway, including LAMP1, a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes [1,2,35]. Furthermore, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, components of the COPII pathway, encoded by the SEC12, 16, 23, and 24 genes, are known to be required for autophagy [37,38,39], making it possible that the Sec13p and Sec31p proteins could have other functions in addition to their known roles in anterograde traffic. The size of the poliovirus-induced vesicles, at 200–400 nm in diameter, does not immediately suggest whether they are related to the COPII or autophagosomal pathways: typical diameters of COPII vesicles and autophagosomes are 50–100 nm [40,41] and 500–1,000 nm, respectively [24,25].
Finally, the idea that poliovirus infection induces autophagosome formation to facilitate viral growth is surprising in view of existing data that autophagy is an effective antimicrobial host response in many cases (reviewed in [42,43]). During herpes virus infection, there is good correlation between the induction of autophagy and the presence of effective antiviral responses. The process of autophagy is thought to be destructive to herpes virus because mutant viruses that fail to inhibit autophagy and other antiviral responses showed large decreases in yield [44]. During Streptococcus infection, genetic disruption of the autophagy pathway in the infected host cells resulted in increased bacterial yield, consistent with a role for autophagy in bacterial clearance [45].
Specific markers for autophagosome formation have become available, facilitating the identification of membranes derived from the autophagic pathway (reviewed in [43,46]). Here, we explore the role of several constituents of autophagosome machinery in poliovirus- and rhinovirus-infected cells by monitoring: the presence of autophagosomal protein LC3 in virally induced vesicles, the acquisition of colocalization of LC3 and LAMP1 in virally infected cells, the viral induction of punctate structures that stain with monodansylcadaverine (MDC), and the effects of perturbing the autophagosomal pathway pharmacologically and via RNA interference on intracellular and extracellular virus yield. Our data support the hypothesis that poliovirus, and likely the closely related rhinovirus, induce the formation of autophagosome-like structures to serve as the membrane scaffolds for RNA replication. We further suggest that double-membraned vesicles, by forming a luminal cytoplasmic compartment, may facilitate prelytic viral exit from infected cells.
To ask whether the membranes on which poliovirus RNA replication complexes assemble contain constituents of autophagosomes, we monitored the localization of both LC3, a specific marker of autophagosomes, and 3A, a critical component of the poliovirus RNA replication complex, in infected cells. LC3 was expressed via DNA transfection as an amino-terminal fusion with green fluorescent protein (GFP). As can be seen in Figure 1, the punctate GFP–LC3 signal colocalized with that of poliovirus RNA replication protein 3A, as visualized by immunofluorescence. No colocalization with poliovirus 3A protein was seen when GFP was not fused to LC3. Therefore, the membranous structures to which 3A and other components of the poliovirus RNA replication complex localize [3] can recruit LC3.
In nonautophagic cells, LC3, originally identified as a microtubule-associated protein [47], and LAMP1, a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes, do not colocalize. However, during autophagy, LC3 has been shown to colocalize with lysosomal protein LAMP1, defining the maturation of the nascent autophagosome to the autophagosome [28,48,49]. This process can be seen in Figure 2A, in which LC3 and LAMP1 were shown to colocalize almost completely in MCF-7 cells upon treatment with tamoxifen, a known inducer of autophagy. Similarly, rapamycin treatment of HeLa cells led to the colocalization of GFP–LC3 and LAMP-1, while they remained distinct in untreated cells (Figure 2A). By 3 h postinfection with poliovirus, the LAMP1 and GFP–LC3 signals in HeLa cells also began to colocalize (Figure 2B); this time corresponds to the beginning of viral RNA synthesis in infected HeLa cells [50]. By 4.5 h postinfection, the LAMP1 and GFP–LC3 signals had merged almost completely (Figure 2B). The colocalization of GFP–LC3 and LAMP1 characteristic of autophagosome formation was also seen in cells infected with either of two different serotypes of human rhinovirus (Figure 2C).
Expression of poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A in isolation can induce the formation of double-membraned vesicles that display biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those formed in poliovirus-infected cells [35]. However, expression of poliovirus protein 2BC alone has been shown to induce the formation of single-membraned vesicles in both mammalian cells and S. cerevisiae [4,35,51,52]. Expression of poliovirus 3A protein in isolation, on the other hand, reduces the rate of ER-to-Golgi traffic and distends ER membranes [36,53]. To test whether 2BC, 3A, or both were sufficient to induce colocalization of GFP–LC3 and LAMP1 as observed in poliovirus-infected cells, proteins 2BC and 3A were expressed singly or in combination in 293T cells in the presence of GFP–LC3. As shown in Figure 3, colocalization of GFP–LC3 and LAMP1 was not observed in control cells or in cells that expressed either 2BC or 3A in isolation. However, coexpression of 2BC and 3A caused GFP–LC3 and LAMP1 to colocalize (Figure 3A), as was seen in cells infected with poliovirus or rhinoviruses treated with tamoxifen or treated with rapamycin (see Figure 2).
To examine further whether the membranes induced during poliovirus infection display additional characteristics of autophagosomes, we employed fluorescent staining with MDC. Under specific fixation conditions, MDC is retained in autophagosomal membranes [54,55]. As shown in Figure 4, treatment of MCF7 human breast tumor cells with tamoxifen caused the accumulation of punctate structures that retained staining with MDC after fixation. Similar punctate staining was observed in cells infected for 5 h with rhinovirus 14 (Figure 4A) or for 3 h or more with poliovirus (see Figure 4B).
To test the hypothesis that the MDC-stained structures observed in Figure 4 were the same as the GFP–LC3-containing structures observed in Figure 2, we monitored the localization of GFP–LC3 with MDC. As a live stain, MDC is a poor marker for autophagosomes, because both autophagic membranes and lysosomes are visualized [46]. However, if cells are subjected to a defined fixation protocol after staining with MDC, the dye can be removed from single-membraned, but not double-membraned, vesicles [54,55]. As shown in Figure 5, good colocalization of MDC and LC3 was observed in poliovirus-infected cells, and no evidence of the punctate MDC staining expected of lysosomal membranes could be seen in uninfected cells.
To determine whether the autophagosome-like membranes induced during poliovirus infection perform an antiviral function or facilitate viral replication, we tested the effect on poliovirus yield of pretreating H1–HeLa cells with either tamoxifen or rapamycin, known inducers of autophagy. Yield of intracellular virus increased approximately 4-fold when cells were pretreated with tamoxifen, and 3-fold upon pretreatment with rapamycin (Figure 6A and 6B). Conversely, when cells were treated with 3-methyladenine, a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy [56], yield of intracellular virus was decreased (Figure 6C). Therefore, during poliovirus infection, the activity of the autophagy pathway correlates with productive viral replication, not with viral destruction.
To extend the studies with pharmacological agents, we tested the effect of reducing the amount of intracellular autophagy proteins LC3 and Atg12p on poliovirus yield, using double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides designed to target their mRNAs for destruction by RNA interference. Pools of double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized to target ATG12 mRNA, and to target both LC3A and LC3B mRNAs (see Materials and Methods). As shown in Figure 7, the intracellular abundance of Atg12p and LC3 proteins could be reduced to 70% and 90%, respectively, of their abundance in cells treated with control double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) known to target firefly luciferase mRNA. These reductions in Atg12p and LC3 protein concentration resulted in 3-fold and 4-fold reductions, respectively, in yields of intracellular poliovirus. Even stronger effects of the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated reduction in autophagy proteins on viral yield were observed, however, when the yields of extracellular virus were examined. The effects of RNAi against ATG12 and LC3 on extracellular virus were 9-fold and 20-fold, respectively (Figure 7). Two potential mechanisms for this preferential reduction in extracellular, as opposed to intracellular virus, seemed possible. The first possibility was that the RNAi-mediated reductions in the intracellular concentrations of Atg12p and LC3 protein reduced cell lysis and therefore lytic release of virus; links between autophagy and apoptosis have been reported (reviewed in [57,58]). The possibility of decreased cellular susceptibility to lysis upon RNAi treatment is difficult to exclude. However, early cell lysis in the presence of reduced Atg12p or LC3 concentrations seemed unlikely because the amounts of virus released were very small, and the observed reductions in extracellular virus release were seen at early time points, before lysis was expected.
A second possibility for the greater reduction in extracellular than intracellular virus is that double-membraned structures with the cytoplasm provide a topologically reasonable mechanism for nonlytic release of cytoplasmic contents. Ultrastructural analysis studies of cells infected with poliovirus [1,2] and with rhinovirus 14 (Figure 8A) have revealed the presence of virions and other cytoplasmic material within the lumen of double-membraned vesicles. Presumably, these are double-membraned vesicles that formed relatively late in infection and were therefore able to trap viruses already present in the nearby cytoplasm. The known proximity of RNA replication, protein expression, and virion packaging to the membrane-associated replication complexes [59,60] should facilitate such events. Figure 8B displays an image consistent with the release of the packets of cytosol expected if the outer bilayer of a multilamellar membrane structure were to fuse with the plasma membrane. Figure 8C shows that, in poliovirus-infected cells, such blebs can contain LC3, and Figure 8D shows that they can also contain VP1, a viral capsid protein.
In this work, we have shown that several hallmarks of cellular autophagosomes, including the localization of GFP–LC3 into discrete punctate structures and staining with MDC followed by fixation, can be observed in human cells whether they are treated with tamoxifen or infected with poliovirus or rhinovirus. Furthermore, we have employed a new criterion for autophagy, the colocalization of LC3 and LAMP1, to demonstrate that this intracellular rearrangement was observed in cells treated with tamoxifen, infected with picornaviruses (poliovirus, rhinovirus 2, or rhinovirus 14) or transfected with plasmids that express poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A (see Figures 2 and 8). Taken together with the previously observed double-membraned morphology, cytoplasmic contents, and complex origin of the membranous structures induced during poliovirus infection [1,2,35], we argue that the viruses utilize components of the autophagosome formation pathway to form the characteristic double-membraned vesicles seen during infection.
Do the autophagosome-like membranous structures induced by poliovirus act as scaffolds for RNA replication, or are they part of the host antiviral response? The numerous positive correlations between the functional presence of autophagosomal pathways and increased viral yield lead us to conclude that the autophagosome-like structures observed during poliovirus infection are not antiviral. Instead, we argue that the double-membraned vesicles induced during poliovirus infection facilitate poliovirus replication, and we hypothesize that poliovirus, rhinovirus 2, and rhinovirus 14 subvert the constituents of the cellular autophagy pathway to form membranous scaffolds on which RNA replication complexes can assemble.
Other positive-strand RNA viruses that have been shown to localize their RNA replication complexes to double-membraned vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells are equine artirivirus [61], murine hepatitis virus [62], and SARS virus [63]. The membranes associated with murine hepatitis virus infection have been shown recently to contain LC3 protein [64]. Strikingly, infection of murine ES cell lines deficient for APG5 with murine hepatitis virus was shown to result in a large decrease in the extracellular yield of this enveloped virus; the effect on intracellular viral particles or RNA was not reported. Nevertheless, the large reduction in yield of extracellular virus seen in the absence of Atg5p protein argues that this component of the cellular autophagy pathway is crucial for some step in the formation or egress of infectious virions of this murine coronavirus [64].
For both poliovirus and equine artirivirus, molecular inducers of double-membraned vesicle formation have been identified. Specifically, coexpression of poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A is required to accumulate double-membraned vesicles [35] and to elicit the colocalization of GFP–LC3 and LAMP1 that correlates with the formation of autophagosomes (see Figure 3A). For equine artirivirus, the coexpression of viral proteins nsp2 and nsp3 is sufficient to induce the formation of double-membraned vesicles [65]. We anticipate that these viral proteins, likely to be capable of mimicking, intercepting, or corrupting the pathway of cellular autophagy, will prove to be useful tools to decipher its mechanism.
Recent work has highlighted an important role for autophagy in the innate immune response of vertebrates to intracellular pathogens. For example, induction of autophagy has been shown to promote clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from infected macrophage [66]. Furthermore, during infection with Shigella flexneri, the wild-type function of the bacterial icsB gene was shown to be required to prevent autophagic degradation, a process that the authors argue is specifically induced by a bacterial protein, the product of the virG gene [67].
Like S. flexneri, successful microorganisms often display strategies to evade potent host defenses. Furthermore, some microorganisms actively subvert otherwise effective host defense responses for their own benefit: for example, the growth of mink focus-forming virus requires apoptotic caspase activity for the maturation of a nonstructural protein [68], and murine cytomegalovirus encodes a chemokine homolog to attract cells of the immune system to the site of infection, which then promote viral dissemination (reviewed in [69]). Similarly, precedents are beginning to be established in which the autophagic pathway or its constituents may be subverted by intracellular pathogens to benefit their own replication (reviewed in [42,43]). As shown in Figure 9, the pathway of autophagosome formation ends with the acquisition of the lysosomal proteases and lipases that render the autophagosome a degradative organelle [27,28]. Mature autolysosomes are no longer bounded by double membranes because the inner membrane and luminal contents are degraded, becoming electron-dense and compact [24]. In Legionella infection, several genes, termed Dot or Icm genes, are required to retard the progression of autophagosome maturation, presumably to benefit bacterial growth within organelles that subvert components of the autophagosome [70,71,72]. We argue that poliovirus, rhinovirus 2, rhinovirus 14, equine encephalitis virus [65], and murine hepatitis virus [64] have similarly evolved a mechanism to accumulate autophagosome-like membranes in the cytoplasm for the duration of the infection. To maintain most of these structures in their double-membraned form, viral infection may both induce their formation and prevent their maturation into degradative organelles.
Why would a virus choose a double-membraned, autophagosome-like vesicle on which to replicate its RNA? Not all positive-strand RNA viruses utilize such structures. For example, Flock House virus RNA replication complexes assemble on outer mitochondrial membranes [73]. When the RNA replication complexes of a subgenomic Flock House virus RNA were experimentally redirected to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER of S. cerevisiae, the yield of replicated RNA actually increased [73]. Therefore, viral RNA replication displayed no mitochondrion-specific requirement for specific lipids, proteins, or processes. Presumably, however, there are reasons why particular positive-strand RNA viruses target particular intracellular membranes on which to assemble their replication complexes, some of which might not be assayed under single-cycle growth conditions in tissue culture.
A larger effect on extracellular than intracellular virus yield was observed when the abundance of autophagy proteins Atg12p and LC3 was reduced by RNAi (see Figure 7). Possible explanations for the observed preferential decrease in extracellular virions are that the reduction in autophagosome machinery decreased cell lysis early in infection, or that reduced abundance of autophagosomal machinery decreased nonlytic viral escape. Although our data do not yet distinguish between these hypotheses, we will discuss the latter possibility because nonlytic delivery of cytosol to the extracellular milieu could be a unique characteristic of multilamellar vesicles, and we were able to obtain ultrastructural images consistent with this interpretation (see Figure 8).
Nominally lytic viruses are often assumed to spread exclusively via cell lysis. However, the possibility of nonlytic viral release, even for nonenveloped viruses such as poliovirus, has been suggested from numerous reports of persistently infected cell lines that continuously secreted infectious particles [74,75,76,77]. Even more convincingly, when polarized Caco-2 cultures, growing as intact monolayers, as shown by resistance to the passage of dyes and electric current between the apical and basolateral surfaces, were infected with poliovirus, newly synthesized virus was shown to emerge from only the apical surface [78]. That the egress of this virus did not correspond to a detectable breach in the monolayer argued that a nonlytic, and polarized exit route of unknown origin had been utilized.
We suggest a potential mechanism for this nonlytic release of cytosolic viral particles via the formation of double-membraned vesicles throughout the course of infection. Early in infection, the double-membraned structures would entrap cytosol, but this cytosol would be free of virions. However, at later stages of infection, the cytosol trapped by newly generated double-membraned structures would often contain viral particles. Poliovirions and related enteroviruses are relatively resistant to the low pH and active proteolysis that would prevail within the lumen of these vesicles should they mature [79,80]. As depicted in Figure 9, the fusion of the outer membrane of an intact double-membraned structure would result in the release of membrane-bound packets of cytoplasm into the extracellular milieu, whereas fusion of the membrane of a mature autophagosome would result in the direct release of cytosolic contents, and incompletely resolved double-membrane structures would result in the formation of more complex topologies. The presence of both LC3 and poliovirus capsid protein VP1 in extracellular structures adjacent to poliovirus-infected cells (see Figure 8C and 8D) is consistent with the release of at least partially intact packets of cytoplasm during poliovirus infection. We speculate that the formerly intracellular membranes surrounding these packets of cytoplasm would be short-lived outside the cell, with free virus being the eventual result.
Recently, HIV has been shown to exit human macrophages via the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, rather than by directly budding from the cell surface as in HIV-infected T cells [81,82,83]. HIV gag protein directs the targeting of HIV particles to multivesicular bodies via direct binding to cellular protein Tsg101 [84,85], a component of the ESCRT complex required for the sorting of proteins into endosomes [86,87,88]. Similarly, the intracellular formation of double-membraned vesicles in poliovirus-infected cells provides a topologically reasonable mechanism for the extracellular delivery of cytosolic contents in the absence of cell lysis. We speculate that a mechanism to spread virus within tissues of infected hosts without cell lysis could provide an advantage to those positive-strand viruses that subvert constituents of the cellular pathway of autophagosome formation.
Poliovirus Mahoney type 1 was isolated following transfection with an infectious cDNA [89] and propagated as previously described [34]. “Tet-off” MCF7 cells were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, California, United States) and propagated in DMEM + 10% FBS; MCF7 cells are highly inducible for autophagosome formation in response to tamoxifen [9]. Poliovirus stocks were titered on both HeLa H1 and MCF7 cells. The multiplicities of infections indicated refer to titers on the appropriate cell lines. H1–HeLa cells were used due to their permissiveness for rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus stocks were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (
ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, United States). Virus stocks were prepared in H1–HeLa cells (
ATCC) grown in EMEM supplemented with 0.2 M HEPES and 0.1 M MgCl2, and viral titers were measured by TCID50 as described previously [90].

To construct the GFP–LC3 fusion protein-expressing plasmid, LC3B sequences were amplified by PCR from a Human Lung Library (ResGen, Carlsbad, California, United States) using targeted primers containing EcoRI sites (
ACTGAATTCCCATGCCGTCGGAGAAG and
TTTGAATTCTTACACTGACAATTTCA). The LC3A coding region was then inserted into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States) to create an EGFP–LC3 fusion protein under the control of the CMV immediate-early promoter. Expression of poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A was performed as described previously [35]. The 293T cells, which express SV40 T antigen, were used to facilitate expression from the SV40 promoter in these plasmids.

Cells were fixed using freshly made 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Poliovirus protein 3A and cellular protein LAMP1 were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. For visualization of poliovirus 3A protein in the presence of GFP–LC3, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in a PBS solution that also contained 0.5% saponin, 10 mM sodium azide, 0.125% BSA, 3A monoclonal tissue culture supernatant at a dilution of 1:30, and rhodamine-linked antimouse secondary antibody (SC-2084, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, California, United States) at a dilution of 1:200. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min, washed twice with PBS, and placed under Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States). Visualization of LAMP1 was performed using a monoclonal LAMP1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Kentucky, United States) at a dilution of 1:200.
MDC (Sigma, St. Louis, United States) was stored at −20 °C under desiccant. A fresh stock solution of 5 mM MDC was made in 1:1 DMSO/EtOH immediately prior to adding to cultures. At 1 h before fixation, fresh medium that contained either 10 μM MDC in DMSO/EtOH or an equivalent volume of DMSO/EtOH was added to the cells. The cells were then fixed using a freshly made 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and imaging was performed immediately. To ensure that membrane vesiculation induced by methods other than the induction of autophagy did not show similar MDC staining patterns, Golgi vesiculation was induced with 5 μM ilimaquinone [91] or 5 μM nocodazole [92]; the disappearance of intact Golgi was confirmed using BODIPY-C5 ceramide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States). Under these conditions, punctate MDC staining was not observed (data not shown).
Microscopic analysis was carried out on an Olympus IX70 at 100X magnification. Images were captured and deconvolved using SoftWorx 2.50 on an SGI Octane workstation. MDC staining was detected at 360 nm excitation/457 nm emission. GFP–LC3 expression was detected at 490 nm excitation/528nm emission. Rhodamine was detected at 555 nm excitation/617 nm emission. Individual images from each stack were saved as TIFF files and processed in Adobe Photoshop 7.0.
siRNA SMARTpools, consisting of four RNA duplexes targeting the gene of interest, and a control siRNA targeting firefly luciferase, were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colorado, United States). For LC3, both LC3A and LC3B RNAs [93] were targeted, bringing the total number of transfected duplexes to eight. Pools consisted of an equal amount of each duplex. The siRNA sequences are given as sense/antisense pairs. The siRNA sequences for ATG12 were:

Cells were grown to densities of 1—5 × 105 per 6-cm dish in 2.5 ml EMEM without antibiotics, and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) according to manufacturer's instructions. For each 6-cm dish, 100 total pmol of pooled siRNA was diluted in 250 μl of serum-free OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) and, separately, 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was diluted in 250 μl of OptiMEM. After an incubation of 5 min at room temperature, the diluted RNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The 500-μl mixture was then added to each dish and gently rocked to spread the lipid–RNA complexes. Growth curves and immunoblots were performed 48 h after transfection. Total cell extracts were made using RSB-NP40 extraction buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Extract was separated on a 15% Laemmli gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane for Western blotting. Anti-LC3 immunoblotting was performed using rabbit antibody raised commercially (AnaSpec, San Jose, California, United States) against a peptide comprising the first 16 amino acids of murine LC3 (MPSEKTFKQRRSFEQR). Anti-Atg12p and anti-GAPDH immunoblotting was performed using antibodies from Zymed (South San Francisco, California, United States) and Research Diagnostics (Flanders, New Jersey, United States), respectively. Antibodies were diluted 1:3,000 in a PBS solution that also contained 0.1% Tween-20 and 2% BSA, and detected with alkaline-phosphatase conjugated goat antirabbit antibody, at a dilution of 1:10,000 using the ECF reagent from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, New Jersey, United States).
For cryofixation and EM analysis, H1–HeLa cells were grown in EMEM supplemented with 0.2 M HEPES and 0.1 M MgCl2 in flasks. Cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell for poliovirus or 50 TCID50/cell for rhinovirus, then washed three times with PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.15 M mannitol in PBS and collected by centrifugation. Aliquots of the resulting pellet were frozen in a Balzers HPM 10 high-pressure freezing apparatus as described previously [2] and stored in liquid nitrogen. To observe cellular ultrastructure, samples were freeze-substituted in 0.1% tannic acid in acetone at −80 °C, rinsed in acetone, then warmed at −20 °C in the presence of 2% osmium tetroxide in acetone for 16 h, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 4 h. After rinsing in acetone at 4 °C, samples were embedded in Epon-Araldite resin. Thin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate and imaged at 80 kV in a JEOL 100C or Philips CM10 EM. For immunostaining, high-pressure frozen samples were freeze-substituted in 0.1% glutaraldehyde-0.05% uranyl acetate in acetone, embedded, stained, and visualized as described previously [35].

13. The immediate effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic on childbirth in Taiwan
The first probable case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan was identified on March 14, 2003 [1]. The epidemic became elevated at the end of April and reached its peak in May and June. Finally, the epidemic ended when Taiwan was officially removed from the World Health Organization (WHO) list of SARS affected countries on July 5, 2003 [1-3]. The fear of SARS spread over all of Taiwan and was mainly directed at those regional hospitals and medical centers where outbreaks had occurred and where SARS patients were being treated. People's fears originated with the novelty of the disease, its rapid nosocomial transmission, and the apparent vulnerability of hospitals and health care workers. Many people started to wonder whether the overwhelming fears of SARS directed at the regional hospitals and medical centers changed a patient's care seeking behavior and even physicians' treatment patterns, and thereby had possible health consequences, especially for those whose survival or state of health depended on routine and/or continuous medical care.
Delivery of a child is a classic example. Under normal circumstances, distance and quality are believed to be two major determinants in a patient's choice for obstetrics care [4-7]. In this study, we sought to estimate the influence of people's fears of SARS on people's choice of provider, mode of child delivery, and length of hospital stay before, during and after the delivery. The people's fears include fears of patients and fears of doctors as choice of mode of delivery and length of stay tend to be a joint decision. The fears of doctors to SARS may also reduce cesarean section rate and shorten the length of stay for lowering the possibility of acquiring SARS. Considering the fact that hospital levels [5,8-15], (mode of delivery [16,17], and length of maternity stay [18-25] are significantly associated with postpartum maternal and neo-natal health status, the question whether the fears of SARS led patients to transfer from a more advanced hospital to a less advanced hospital becomes an important quality of care concern. Health consequences resulting from these behavioral changes due to people's fears of SARS should not be overlooked [26-29]. The results could provide public health agencies an important reference when assessing the consequences of the SARS epidemic on quality of care. So that when SARS re-emerges or other similar new infectious disease emerges, it can guide obstetricians and public health professionals to prevent avoidable health consequences because of people's fears concerning these new and strongly infectious diseases.
Since its implementation in March 1995, the National Health Insurance (NHI) program provides a mandatory and comprehensive universal health care coverage for all Taiwanese residents. For obstetrics care, a wide range of services including pre-natal, delivery, and neo-natal care are extensively covered under the NHI program. Both vaginal and cesarean deliveries are covered and no co-insurance is required for child delivery. The program offers patients complete freedom of choice among providers and methods of delivery. In order to contain the in-patient costs for Western medical services, the NHI program has instituted the case-payment method for 50 clearly defined medical conditions, and they include both vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. Case payment is similar to the DRG (diagnosis-related groups) payment system in the U.S. It bundles itemized medical services essential for each condition and provides financial incentives for a more efficient delivery process. The case payment system reimburses the provider on a per-case basis, and the payment varies by accreditation level of the provider. It also assumes that the complexity or quality of care also varies by provider level. The current accreditation system categorizes medical institutions into 4 levels, from most advanced to most basic: medical center, regional hospital, district hospital, and clinic. The accreditation criteria include infrastructure, capacity, manpower, volume, management and administrative processes. For vaginal delivery, the case payment ranges from NT$17,420 per case in medical centers to NT$15,100 per case in clinics. For cesarean delivery, the range is larger (from NT$32,330 per case in medical centers to NT$27,170 per case in clinics). Furthermore, the National Health Insurance Law prohibits its contracted providers from any direct/extra billing for any service covered by the NHI program.
This study conducted a population-based descriptive analysis of changes in market share, cesarean rate, and length of maternity stay, for each of the four levels of provider, before, during and after the SARS epidemic. This study retrieved all 448,365 NHI in-patient claims for childbirth from January 01, 2002 to December 31, 2003. Vaginal deliveries were those coded with the NHI Case Payment-DRG 0373A and 0373C. Cesarean deliveries were those coded with the NHI Case Payment-DRG 0371A and 0373B. Each claim cites the patient, provider, diagnoses, treatment procedures, mode of delivery, and admission and discharge dates. A unique provider identification number was used to link the NHI provider file, which identifies provider accreditation level.
As the SARS epidemic started in March, elevated in May, and finally ended in July, we divided the study period into 5 sub-periods: pre-SARS period from January 2002 to February 2003 (t0), initial SARS period from March 2003 to April 2003 (t1), peak SARS period from May 2003 to June 2003 (t2), final SARS period from July 2003 to August 2003 (t3) and post-SARS period from September 2003 to December 2003 (t4). Monthly average estimates for market share, cesarean rate, length of maternity stay, all by accreditation level were calculated and expressed in numbers and percentages. Mean differences in average cesarean rate and average length of maternity stay between the pre-SARS and the peak periods (t2 - t0), and between the pre-SARS and post-SARS periods (t4 - t0) were determined by 2-tailed t tests. The data were managed and analyzed by using SAS, Version 8.2. All analyses were tested for significance by using an alpha of .05. Since no human participants were involved, no IRB approval is necessary. The confidentiality assurances were addressed by abiding the data regulations of the Bureau of National Health Insurance, which stipulated the data only for use of this research.
Figure 1 shows the changes in the market share of delivery services by accreditation level of provider in the five sub-periods. In terms of market share, before the SARS epidemic, although clinics still had the largest market share, they were slowly losing their share to their powerful competitors, the medical centers and the regional hospitals. However, people's fears of SARS reversed this situation during the SARS epidemic, as patients switched to clinics during the SARS epidemic to deliver their child, rather than in the larger academic medical centers and regional hospitals. A dramatic drop in market share was observed for both the medical centers and the regional hospitals during the SARS epidemic. While at the same time both district hospitals and clinics gained market share. In addition, Table 1 shows the changes in monthly average number of deliveries, and the market share of delivery services by accreditation level of provider in the 3 key sub-periods (pre-SARS, peak-SARS, and post-SARS periods). Generally speaking, over the past several years Taiwan has experienced a constant decreasing fertility rate. On average, there were 2,189 fewer deliveries each month during the peak SARS period than during the pre-SARS period. Compared to the pre-SARS period (t0), medical centers and regional hospitals dropped 5.2% and 4.1% in market shared during the peak SARS period (t2), but district hospitals and clinics increased 2.1% and 7.1%, respectively. Although medical centers and regional hospitals regained some of their lost market share during the post-SARS period (t4), they still did not fully regain their market shares at the pre-SARS level (medical centers: 2.0%; regional hospitals: 0.8%).
Table 2 compares the changes in monthly average cesarean section rates and length of stay (LOS) in the pre-, peak- and post-SARS periods (t0, t2, and t4). Compared to the pre-SARS period, we observed only a marginal decrease in overall cesarean rate (1.0%), but a significantly larger increase in cesarean rate in medical centers (2.2%) and significantly decrease in clinics (1.9%) during the peak SARS period (t2). One plausible explanation is that as normal or less complicated deliveries shifted to lower level hospitals or clinics, those cases that remained in the medical centers tended to be complicated ones which required cesarean sections. Hence, although women shifted their place of delivery from higher level hospitals to lower level hospitals/clinics due to a greater risk of exposure to SARS at these higher level hospitals, their choice of delivery method did not seem to change. In addition, the average cesarean section rate in medical centers returned to the pre-SARS level during the post-SARS period while the cesarean section rates in lower level hospitals and clinics showed the opposite. The cesarean section rates in regional, district hospitals and clinics dropped significantly during the post-SARS period from their levels before the SARS epidemic. Furthermore, Table 2 and Figure 2 present changes in average LOS among different provider levels. As expected, in order to reduce their potential risk of exposure to SARS, people tried to minimize their maternal stay in a hospital as much as possible. The overall average length of stay decreased from 3.40 days to 3.25 days from the pre-SARS period (t0) to the peak SARS period (t2), and then returned to 3.39 days after the SARS epidemic (t4). More specifically, significant reductions in average LOS were observed in all hospital levels except for clinics at t2. Average length of stay was shortened by 0.21 days in medical centers (5.6%), 0.21 days in regional hospitals (5.8%), and 0.13 days in district hospitals (3.8%). Average LOS in clinics remained basically unchanged. However, as soon as the SARS epidemic ended, average LOS in most hospitals and clinics not only returned to the pre-SARS level, but became slightly longer than it was prior to SARS, which is not significant statistically speaking.
Our results, based on a population-based study, demonstrate that if the use of medical care required was essential and could not be deferred, such as childbirth, the fears of SARS, including both fears of patients and fears of doctors, had a significant influence on patients' preference for provider and on their length of in-patient stay. However, it did not necessarily influence their choice of therapies during the SARS epidemic. Even though the SARS influence upon a patient's decision regarding the length of stay ended with the end of the epidemic, the fear of SARS remained influential on how people chose their place of delivery. During the SARS epidemic, large amounts of patients shifting from more advanced hospitals to less advanced hospitals and substantially, reducing their length of maternity stay simply out of fear could result in a serious concern for quality of care, especially for a patient's accessibility to quality care and the continuity of that care. For example, patients transferring to a less advanced hospital could severely compromise their access to more sophisticated technologies and interrupt their continuity of care. This in turn could endanger the lives of the mothers and their babies [5,8-14]. (Significantly shorter length of stay increases the risk of a premature discharge and compromise the quality of care, which again could lead to adverse health outcomes for both mother and baby [23-25,30].
Furthermore, not only the physicians who may directly encounter with SARS patients need to be alert and better trained for this type of outbreak, obstetricians should also be aware and extremely cautious about suddenly substantial patient shift and strong demand of shorter length of maternity stay posed by the public's fear of such an outbreak. As these sudden changes in people's behaviors are likely to hinder patient's continuity of care and cause adverse maternal and neonatal health consequences, it is essential for obstetricians to be well prepared to deal with these consequences during an outbreak.
A few study limitations should be noted. First, due to data and time constraints, this study only shows the immediate impacts of the fears of SARS on the shifting of patients from one facility to another, as well as their length of stay. This study cannot confirm whether these changes led to any long term adverse maternity or perinatal outcomes. If in the post-SARS period, mother's and child's morbidity and mortality remained the same, the residual increase of child births in clinics and district hospitals would be a positive impact since it reduces health care costs without compromising health outcomes. Future research with a longer post-SARS observational period and more detailed maternal and perinatal outcome information could help to advance our knowledge in this regard. Second, the significant amount of patient shifting observed among provider levels suggests that the fear of SARS changed people's preference as to their choice of provider during the SARS epidemic. Whether this influence will persist remains to be seen. Third, since we only focused on childbirth in this study, the results may not be generalizable to other medical conditions. Patient behavior may very well differ for medical conditions/diseases with different levels of severity and/or medical urgency. Furthermore, the influence of the fear of SARS on other important patient behaviors, such as their decision to seek care or not during the SARS epidemic if their medical needs could be deferred or suspended to a later time, remains uncertain. There are many questions that remain to be answered concerning the possible impacts of SARS on various aspects of health care.
In terms of policy implications, the medical centers and regional hospitals in Taiwan took on the majority of the responsibility in caring for the more severe SARS cases, and by doing so lost their market share to district hospitals and clinics because of people's fear of SARS. The BNHI negotiated with these hospitals to compensate them for their loss of revenue during the SARS epidemic, and bring it up to the previous year's level. It is expected that by minimizing a hospital's financial loss it will increase that hospitals' willingness to admit SARS patients and secure people's access to proper medical care in the likelihood of a re-emergence of a SARS epidemic or any other pandemic. Strategies which help to restore people's confidence in those hospitals that have admitted SARS patients should be part of the long term solution.
Finally, while internationally all of the global attention is focused on the direct causalities of SARS, serious quality of care concerns resulting from people's behavioral changes due to their fears of SARS should not be overlooked. Taiwan's experience could provide valuable lessons to other countries in assessing full impacts of the SARS epidemic and help to minimize adverse health consequences when SARS or other similar pandemic emerge.

14. Australian public health policy in 2003 – 2004
While early global anxiety over SARS occupied headlines between February and May, the more persistent popular headline in 2003 focused on obesity. Summits were held in NSW and Victoria, while the National Obesity Taskforce was convened under the auspice of the Australian Health Ministers Council (AHMC).
When Kay Patterson was the Federal Health Minister, she declared that prevention was the fourth pillar of Medicare and she wanted to be 'Minister for Prevention'. Indeed, the 2003/04 federal budget, although limited, contained a bundle of initiatives entitled "Prevention on the Health Agenda". In particular, a number of immunisation and health promotion programs were included.
Significant amongst the funding initiatives for public health announced in 2003/04 was government support for the meningococcal vaccine. Although this was the culmination of many months of careful planning, a perception existed that this only occurred after considerable public interest in and anxiety about deaths from outbreaks of this disease.
Further changes to the recommended schedule in 2003 were made by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), in particular the inclusion of pneumococcal and varicella vaccines; however, these did not result in similar prescribed vaccine programs or in similar funding. These three developments are reviewed in greater detail in the next section.
The National Public Health Partnership (NPHP) and the AHMC adopted the influenza pandemic plan in October 2003, and with the advent of the newly-identified disease SARS, as well as outbreaks of meningococcal disease, management and prevention of communicable diseases was prominent. Following on from the significant funding boost for bioterrorism preparedness in 2002/03, public health preparedness became a more generic theme.
The arrival of SARS occupied the national popular and political imagination as well as tested the infrastructure capacity of public health. Australia fared well during the outbreak. Apart from escaping with only six Australian cases, it provided an opportunity to establish a coordinated approach between the Commonwealth and the states/territories and also contributed to the global epidemiological investigation and prevention effort. SARS also prompted amendments to the Quarantine Act [4].
While the recall following the Pan Pharmaceutical crisis put the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) under the spotlight, it also managed to conclude negotiations that had been in train for several years on a Trans-Tasman regulatory regime and authority. Also on the regulatory front, the Australian New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council endorsed a nutrition, health and related claims policy guidelines and established a review of genetically modified (GM) labeling of foods [5]. All these developments pointed to the global nature of public health, and the intersection between public health activities and the economy.
Policy development in public health has never been confined to a set of health programs, and in 2003/04, the lead was often taken from outside the health sector. Most significant was the adoption of the National Agenda for Early Childhood [6], pushed by public health advocates for child health since the mid 1990s. The National Public Health Partnership responded by coordinating a scoping of child health strategies across Australia. Elsewhere in Government, "Promoting and Maintaining Good Health" was adopted as one of the National Research Priorities [7]. Healthy ageing also emerged as a policy theme in Ageing Research.
Public health workforce development was pursued outside the mainstream education and training arrangements for public health in universities. The Community Services and Health Training Board commissioned a consultative process to develop population health competencies for the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector [8]. New population health qualifications and competencies were proposed for incorporation into the Health Training Package – including certificates in population health and in environmental health, and diplomas in population health and in indigenous environmental health.
The release in 2003 of the report "Returns on Investments in Public Health: an epidemiological and economic analysis" [9] (often referred to as the Abelson report), may have a significant impact in subsequent years. Commissioned several years earlier by the Population Health Division of the Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA), the report experienced a relatively low profile until Derek Wanless visited from the UK. Having chaired a review that contributed to a significant budgetary increase for the NHS, Wanless had been commissioned by the British Treasury to examine prevention across government. In September 2003, at a meeting in Canberra with senior officials across key agencies, Wanless marveled at the value of the Abelson report, described in more detail below.
Although 2004 was an election year, public health policy was neither visible during the campaign or in policy development more generally. The Federal Government's initiative to wind up the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission received little publicity and comment, even though it indicated the Commonwealth's increasing tendency to pursue its own pathway, separate from states and territories, and to bring the functions of statutory bodies into departments.
Jurisdictional and annual reports show that across the states and territories, there were multiple plans, draft guidelines, meetings, episodic training and programs across a broad range of areas. Some health issues are being taken up across jurisdictions – particularly tobacco control, sexually transmitted infections, Aboriginal health, and vaccination. Innovative activities were reported in some jurisdictions, such as a new Health Impact Assessment Branch and a new public health training program in Western Australia. There was, however, no apparent consistency in health priorities across the nation, and an apparent divergence in the interests of the states/territories and the federal government.
While the "prevention and management of overweight and obesity" agenda may have appeared to many observers as a new issue in 2003, its arrival was preceded by several years of intensive work. The NHMRC had released Acting on Australia's Weight: Strategic plan for the prevention of overweight and obesity in 1997 [10], the same year the ABS published the findings from the 1995 National Nutrition Survey, revealing that 45% of men and 29% of women in Australia were overweight, with an additional 18% of men and women classified as obese [11]. Furthermore, overweight and obesity were more common in lower socio-economic groups, in rural populations, in some immigrant groups, and in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) peoples.
Despite longstanding national cooperation on nutrition (since the days of the National Better Health Program in the late 1980s), and even more recent national cooperation on physical activity, public and political imagination was not captured until the same issues were recast as 'obesity', with a focus in particular on childhood obesity. Following from the NSW Childhood Obesity Summit in late 2002, the Australian Health Ministers agreed that a national approach was required and established a National Obesity Taskforce [12].
In 2003, NSW Health released it's response to the Summit recommendations and supported the vast majority of the 145 resolutions [13]. The Victorian Department of Human Services also held a summit [14], while Healthy Weight 2008 – Australia's Future was released by the Commonwealth [15]. The NHMRC joined in with release in late 2003 of clinical practice guidelines for general practitioners and other health professionals [16].
While the specifics vary, the major themes and strategies are captured in Healthy Weight 2008. These are summarised in the Table 1.
The Commonwealth strategy is, however, relatively weak on intersectoral policy and regulatory measures. As an illustrative example of the contrast at the state level, implementation in NSW now ranges from school physical activity and nutrition survey, to a school canteen strategy, to negotiating with Commercial Television Australia about their code of practice on advertising in peak children's viewing hours. The Commonwealth apparently chose not to consider how it might exercise its relevant taxation or legislative powers, despite the history of health promotion pointing to the importance of public policy measures beyond the health system.
An examination of the manner in which the obesity issue was framed, and the details contained in the national strategy, raises a number of issues and questions:
- Why was framing the issues as 'obesity' more successful than the focus on 'nutrition' and 'physical activity'? Why did 'obesity' gain traction while the other terms did not?
- Why did the Commonwealth opt for the softer programmatic approach, rather than tackle obesity with stronger public policy measures (such as taxation and regulation), and demonstrate its national leadership capacity?
- Was the absence of stronger public policy measures because 'obesity' is regarded as largely a health issue, rather than a whole-of-government issue? Or was the Government waiting to see if the US opposed the WHO Global Strategy on account of the strength of the industry lobby?
- After a number of years of public concern about eating disorders and whether they arise in part because of promotion of certain types of body image, was the 'obesity' label a backward step for mental health and a return to traditional images of beauty?
- Is there a risk that people, including children, who are labeled as 'overweight and obese' will be stigmatised? To what extent have the voices of affected communities been incorporated into the development of national strategies, if at all?
- Given the correlation between obesity and socioeconomic disadvantage, how would the proposed strategy not exacerbate those inequalities?
- Were children targeted because they are a "captive audience" and therefore easy targets or did the evidence suggest the best return on investment (in terms of health gain and managing demand on the health care system) would come from a focus on children?
- Was the move to appeal to a populist agenda, while simultaneously progressing the longer-term agenda of tackling health inequalities through multi-sectoral partnerships, a triumph for public health advocates?
These complex threads are interwoven. For the moment, the publicly enunciated agenda represents a confluence of a number of rationales.
The 2002/2003 Federal Budget papers stated that "the Government is committed to making disease prevention and health promotion a fundamental pillar of the health system": however, this was not evident in the subsequent 2003/2004 budget. The Government's Focus on Prevention Package in 2002/03 aimed to incorporate disease prevention into the core business of the primary health care system and was reflective of how the public health agenda was evolving at the national level [24]. The package was comprised largely of a range of measures directed at specific diseases, plus a bundle of initiatives for general practitioners, also referred to as the "primary health care system".
Amongst health conditions affecting Australians, breast cancer received the most attention, with the National Breast Cancer Centre being funded to develop a partnership approach to the review and dissemination of new information, along with information, support and management initiatives for rural women diagnosed with breast cancer. Hepatitis C also received some attention, with funding for national education and prevention projects. Financial support was offered for the SARS efforts that had been undertaken by states and territories, in particular for providing medical personnel at international airports. A clear process for assessing priorities under the broad banded National Public Health Program was also flagged.
For purposes of the budget, primary health care was defined as general practitioners, and the measures funded included:
• "Lifestyle prescriptions" to help GPs "raise community awareness and understanding of benefits of preventive health";
• Collaborative approach to learning, training education and support systems;
• Coordinated care plans for people with chronic or terminal conditions; and
• Involvement in multidisciplinary case conferencing.
The budget did not adopt a comprehensive approach to the primary health care system, perhaps because many community health services, which represent the other important arm for delivery of public health services, are the responsibility of states. The timetable for renewing Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and states and territories in 2004 raised in the minds of some stakeholders, the possibility that the Commonwealth might adopt a more comprehensive and strategic approach, linking public health and primary health care funding streams.
Judging by the actual quantum of funds made available in the 2003/2004 budget, it would seem that most elements from the package did not actually receive additional funding, as shown in Table 3. Indeed, many of the GP initiatives, previously cast as improving primary health care, were subsequently packaged as 'prevention'.
The combination of these measures reflected a tight fiscal climate, with little growth in the overall health budget, as well as that of other portfolios. It was also a package that demonstrated relatively limited imagination, with support for established issues (such as breast cancer) and re-packaging general practice measures that were already in train. With Medicare spending "uncapped" (and targeted public health programs "capped"), attaining more prevention dollars through the GP sector may appear to be one of the few ways to 'grow' dollars for prevention. Although this could be considered to be consistent with the Ottawa Charter of "reorienting health services", many GPs are not trained in a population-based approach to practice, and simply providing new for payments to all represents an undifferentiated, uncoordinated and untargeted approach to prevention. If there is limited support to GPs, and little monitoring, then these measures are unlikely to translate into improved health outcomes.
Meanwhile, the strategic framework for chronic disease prevention, adopted by the National Public Health Partnership in 2001, still lacked a policy and budgetary response in 2003/04 and in 2004/05, while states/territories adopting varying measures singly.
Funding for the Tough on Drugs strategy was announced outside the Focus on Prevention package; perhaps due to the fact that the Tough on Drugs was the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary therefore requiring a separate communications strategy, or because the Prime Minister has a strong personal interest in the illicit drug strategy. The range of measures funded (which included introduction of retractable needle and syringe technology, addressing problems related to increased availability and use of psycho stimulants, establishing a research fund, supporting alcohol and drug workforce development needs, promoting access to drug treatment in rural areas, and tackling problems faced by drug users with concurrent mental health problems) certainly suggested more serious government interest and commitment to illicit drugs.
The 2004/05 Budget indicated the Federal Government's agenda in public health had narrowed considerably. $33 million new funding was announced for measures to address emerging risks (such as emergency medicines stockpile, disease surveillance and public health laboratories, health security legislation and incidence response), but only $5.2 million new funding was made available for promotion of healthy lifestyles related to national health priorities (for addressing such as tobacco, alcohol, drugs, injury, and cancer). [25]
During the course of the Howard Government, there has been a gradual process of re-casting the "landscape" of interest groups and policy constituencies. Strong support for breast cancer and zero-tolerance on illicit drugs contrasts sharply with the delays experienced in renewal of the National HIV/Hepatitis C Strategy. The new prominence given to meningococcal vaccine, child health and obesity creates space for other interest groups: even if the re-framing was shaped by nutrition and physical activity lobbies, other clinical interests have been brought into the picture. These developments illustrate how 'political' considerations are important in determining 'public health policy'.
It was interesting however, to observe the interest in prevention from outside the health portfolio, particularly from Treasury. This was motivated in part by the Intergenerational Report and concerns about both the sustainability of Medicare as well as the social and economic cost burden arising from an ageing society. This helped to ensure interest in the Abelson Report[9].
Few countries have conducted research on return of investment from prevention efforts. Australia was praised by Derek Wanless at a high-level consultation for completing such an analysis, during his visit to Canberra while conducting a review for the UK Treasury, "Securing Good Health for the Whole Population"[26]. His final report pointed to Australia and Netherlands as two countries that were increasingly using economic evaluation in public health programs. It will be interesting to see if public health policy analysts and Treasury officials draw on this report in future years. In the future it will be interesting to see if the focus on high-visibility programs can demonstrate short-term economic returns.
Given 2004 was an election year, the "political economy" of prevention programs could arguably have become a focus of future public health policy, with the 2003/4 agenda providing the Government with the opportunity to gauge public reaction to this new positioning and design their election campaign appropriately. This was, however, not the case. The American emphasis on 'preparedness' appears not to resonate with the Australian public in the same way.
From the perspective of public health policy advocates, some lessons that can be drawn from 2003/04 are:
• Government's response to public health proposals are shaped by its understanding of the popular interest and desire to communicate directly with the general public;
• Longer term public health issues which have struggled to gain support can be progressed if they are cleverly shaped to fit the Government's "formula";
• Develop and nurture new advocates, particularly in seeking to engage with the broader health system; and
• Work with the media as partners rather than adversaries
These lessons need to be learned well and quickly, to assist with moving the forum for public health policy debate more into the public domain; beyond an essentially "in house" discourse between politicians, researchers and public health advocates. If a more engaged and informed community takes up a public health issue, government will be more likely to respond.

15. Molecular advances in the cell biology of SARS-CoV and current disease prevention strategies
Following reports of the last case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in July 2003, there has been remarkable progress in several areas of research on the molecular identification of the pathogen and its pathogenesis, replication, genetics, and host immunogenicity, as well as elegant epidemiological studies. The sequence of epidemiological events that unfolded early in the outbreak gave researchers a glimpse into the first new pathogen of the era of globalization. As the year 2002 drew to a close, multiple reports of an "infectious atypical pneumonia" caught public health officials across the globe by surprise and suggested that a new human pathogen had emerged in the Guangdong Province in China [1]. By the end of February 2003, this outbreak of SARS had infected almost 800 patients and caused 31 deaths in the Province [2]. One month later, the disease had spread throughout Asia and into Europe and North America. This epidemic eventually affected more than 8000 people and resulted in approximately 800 deaths worldwide, with mortality rates reaching over 40% in certain populations [3,4].
Electron microscope analysis quickly identified the putative SARS agent as having features associated with coronaviruses. The SARS agent was later unambiguously identified as a new coronavirus member and named SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5-7]. Coronaviruses are enveloped, plus-stranded RNA viruses with the largest RNA genomes known (on the order of 30 kb). Coronaviruses have long been important in the world of veterinary viral diseases. However, previously known human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 cause only minor health problems such as the common cold and gastrointestinal diseases. In contrast, the SARS-CoV pathogen causes fever, pulmonary edema, and diffuse alveolar damage in severely affected individuals (collectively termed severe acute respiratory syndrome) [8]. SARS-CoV is also a unique coronavirus in that, to date, it is the only member known to cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans [8]. Demonstration that SARS-CoV can cause serious public health problems has focused attention on the need to understand the viral replicative strategy and devise prophylactic measures.
The clinical symptoms of SARS are those of a lower respiratory tract infection and are accompanied by damage to the lungs [6,9,10]. Gastrointestinal involvement is also common, with more than 20% of patients presenting with watery diarrhea [11]. Fecal samples from SARS patients taken up to 25 days after onset of disease contain viral RNA, which suggests viral shedding through the bowels [5]. Liver dysfunction has also been reported based on observed necrosis in hepatocytes [9,12]. Post-mortem tissue examination of SARS patients has found the virus presence in lung, bowel, lymph node, liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle samples [13]. The primary mode of SARS-CoV transmission is airborne via droplets [14,15]. However, there are also reports of the presence of replicating virus in blood cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and in the small and large intestine [11,16]. Alternative modes of transmission, such as blood-borne or fecal-oral are therefore possible.
The virus has been isolated from wild animals (Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs) found in the animal markets of Guangdong, China [17]. The actual natural reservoir for SARS-CoV is still unknown. Once transmitted to humans, SARS-CoV appears to evolve to facilitate to human-human transmission. Sequence analysis of different SARS-CoV isolates from early in the epidemic show deletion events occurring in open reading frame 8 (Orf 8) [18]. Identical deletions in Orf 8 have also been seen in animal coronaviruses supporting the idea that SARS-CoV was introduced to humans via an animal intermediate. In addition to deletion events occurring early and late in the epidemic, a slowing of missense mutations is seen over time, with the most extensive changes occurring in the S protein during the early stages of the outbreak [18]. This suggests the virus has undergone some level of adaptation but has ultimately stabilized at a time in the epidemic where SARS-CoV has become more virulent. Deciphering the evolutionary passage of this virus will undoubtedly provide valuable information on preventing future outbreaks.
In the wake of the SARS epidemic, a number of excellent review articles on the clinical and molecular aspects of SARS epidemiology have been published. These reviews have focused primarily on rapid advances made in the identification and characterization of SARS-CoV genomes as well as describing the etiology of the virus and clinical features of the disease [19-21]. Now the SARS-CoV story has entered a new phase, a search for preventative strategies and a cure. In this review, we highlight the progress made in revealing the molecular aspects of SARS-CoV biology and how such information may lead to strategies for disease prevention.
Coronaviruses are subdivided into three groups based on genetic and serological markers [22]. Groups I, and II infect mammals while group III is specific for avian species. Group I members are the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), feline and canine coronavirus (FCoV and CCoV), and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Group II includes porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine, equine, and rat coronavirus (BCoV, ECoV, and RtCoV), and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Group III includes the turkey coronavirus (TCoV), pheasant coronavirus and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Although most closely related to Group II coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, with some of its unique genetic features, represents a distinct phylogenetic group [22-24].
To date, approximately 61 SARS-CoV genomic sequences have been analyzed representing different phases of the epidemic (early, middle, and late) and two isolates obtained from palm civets [18]. The SARS-CoV genomic RNA is approximately 30 kb and is organized into 13 to 15 open reading frames (ORFs) [25-27]. The SARS CoV structural gene arrangement follows the same pattern as most coronavirus genomes: 5'- Replicase (ORF 1a)-Protease (ORF 1b)-Spike (S)-Envelope (E)-membrane (M)-Nucleocapsid (N)-3' [27]. However, in contrast to other coronaviruses, two ORFs of unknown function are located between the S and E ORFs and 3–5 ORFs are located between M and N. In addition, despite the evolutionary overlap between SARS-CoV and Group II coronavirus genome sequences, the SARS genome lacks a gene for hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, which is common to a majority of Group II coronaviruses [25]. For an excellent pictorial representation of SARS-CoV genome with functions (or lack of) assigned to each ORF, please refer to the recent review by Tan et al [21]. A significant milestone in SARS-CoV molecular biology was the construction of a SARS-CoV full-length cDNA-containing plasmid from which infectious viral RNA can be produced [28]. This development facilitates the study of SARS-CoV gene functions and should promote the elucidation of function for ORFs whose function is still unknown [29]. Although it has been the perception that these ORFs are not essential for viral replication, they may play a role in the manifestation or severity of disease.
RNA viruses utilize a variety of mechanisms to exchange their genetic repertoire. The viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) have a built in error rate that allows diversification of the genomic sequence as replication proceeds. Estimates put the error rate of an RdRp at 10-3 to 10-5 per nucleotide [30]. Coronaviruses also undergo high rates of RNA recombination, providing an additional mechanism by which the viruses can rapidly amplify genomic diversity. The SARS-CoV polymerase gene has a recombination breakpoint, suggesting multiple genetic origins for this molecule. [31]. These evolutionary mechanisms may have facilitated the adaptation of the animal-borne SARS-CoV ancestor to the human host, suggesting that such events in the future could lead to a virus with increased pathogenicity for humans or one capable of infecting multiple species. Recent evidence indicates that the human-adapted SARS virus has crossed into another species. Sequence and epidemiological analyses revealed that a SARS-CoV isolated from a pig was derived from a human strain. Complete nucleotide sequencing of the pig virus isolate (designated TJF) and an S gene-based phylogenetic tree analysis revealed a closer relationship with human SARS-CoV isolates than with animal coronaviruses [32].
Successful viral replication depends upon the ability of the virus to subvert cellular processes to their advantage and counteract cellular defense mechanisms. Such virus-cell interactions represent potential targets for the development of virus-specific antiviral drugs, therapeutics, and prophylactic vaccines. Different viruses, based on their target cell types and entry pathways, differ in their cellular exploitation mechanisms. The mechanism of SARS virus pathogenesis in vivo may reflect both the effect of viral replication in target cells and host immune responses. The molecular basis for SARS-CoV replication, the signaling pathways affected, and the inflammatory responses provoked by viral infection are not yet clearly understood. Progress in these areas should lead to more effective preventive strategies to counter SARS-CoV infections.
It has been shown that the SARS-CoV N protein selectively activates the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) signal transduction pathway, which regulates a wide variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [33]. Such viral induced modifications of the AP-1 pathway may play a significant role in the viral replicative strategy. Recently, another group demonstrated that the S protein alone induces AP-1 activation and that the region from 324–688 amino acids within the S protein is essential for AP-1 activation-dependent IL-8 induction [34]. Another SARS-CoV protein, the U122 ORF of unknown function (also known as X4), was shown to be produced in virus infected Vero E6 cells and expression of this protein alone was shown to induce apoptosis in cell culture [35,36]. This raises the question of how apoptosis of SARS-CoV infected cells is balanced in order for the virus to survive and propagate (Figure 1). This has been addressed to some extent in recent studies which indicate that SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells induces both pro-apoptotic [activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)] and anti-apoptotic [activation of the protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt)] signaling pathways, although Akt induction appears to be insufficient to prevent the virus-induced apoptosis [37,38]. Exactly how SARS-CoV manipulates these cellular signaling pathways to facilitate viral replication remains to be determined.
As mentioned above, IL-8 induction was shown to be dependent upon AP-1 activation by SARS-CoV S protein and in this process NF-κB was not involved [34]. This may partially explain the clinical observation of dramatic cytokine storm (high serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8) and inflammation responses observed in SARS patients in the acute stage associated with lung lesions; it has been also suggested that the elevations of IL-6 and IL-8 due to SARS-CoV infection of the respiratory tract can induce the hyper-innate inflammatory response [39]. It is established that cellular MAPKs regulate AP-1 activation-dependent IL-8 induction in viral infections [40-42]. In SARS-CoV infection, the IL-8 induction signaling pathway is perhaps related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as anti-ACE2 antibodies inhibit IL-8 induction/release [34]. ACE2 is the cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV and the receptor-binding sites on the virion are located in the 12–672 amino acid region of the S protein [43].
Coronavirus genome structure and major gene-product functions have been known for years, but since they cause mild disease, selection of the virus-specific antiviral drugs was not a priority in the past. The SARS-CoV epidemic changed this selective view. Tan et al, 2004, tabulated a screen of available antiviral agents against SARS virus in detail in their recent review [46]. The obvious molecular targets for SARS-CoV antiviral agents are the viral polymerase/replicase, protease, receptor, the viral mRNA cap-1 methyl transferase and NTPase/helicase [47-54]. In addition, a 32-nucleotide long, highly conserved RNA structure in the 3' untranslated region of coronaviruses and astroviruses was identified [55]. This structure resembles the 530 loop of 16s rRNA involved in translation initiation suggesting a possible role for this element in sequestering host translation machinery. The tertiary interactions of this structure create a tunnel lined with negative charge where Mg2+ can bind. This unique structure presents an attractive target for tunnel binding antiviral drugs [55]. Finally, since the functional details of most coronavirus replicase gene products are not known, random screening of potential antiviral compound libraries will be a key area of drug discovery for SARS virus in the near future [47].
Takasuka et al (2004) have reported that subcutaneous administration of UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV virion elicits a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in long-term antibody secretion and memory B cells [60]. The antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the virus. The inactivated virus also induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production upon restimulation with inactivated virus in vitro [60]. These studies suggest that whole-killed virion may have the potential as a candidate antigen for SARS vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity. When SARS-CoV inactivated by beta-propiolactone was used as antigen in mice and rabbits, the animals elicited antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) present in the S1 region of SARS-CoV. These antibodies effectively inhibited the S-protein mediated SARS-pseudovirus entry up to 50%, suggesting the potential of the inactivated SARS-CoV as antigen for vaccine development [61]. Depletion of RBD-specific antibodies from patient or rabbit immune sera by immunoadsorption, significantly reduced the virus neutralizing ability of the sera, suggesting that the RBD epitope in the S protein is a critical determinant in developing vaccine strategies [62].
The N protein of SARS-CoV appears to be more conserved than S and M proteins and it has been suggested that this protein may play a role in cell-mediated immunity in SARS-CoV infections and also is an important viral antigen for the early diagnosis. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with a SARS-CoV N protein expressed by an E1/partially E3-deleted, replication-defective human adenovirus 5 vector was shown to produce potent SARS-CoV-specific humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses, suggesting the potential of this construct to be used as SARS-CoV vaccine [63]. Along the same line, intra-muscular immunization of BALB/c mice with a plasmid DNA construct encoding the full-length N protein was shown to elicit serum anti-N antibodies and spenocyte proliferative responses against the N protein [64]. The immunized mice also produced strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and CD8 (+) CTL responses to the N protein, suggesting that the N protein is not only an important B cell immunogen, but also can elicit broad-based cellular immune responses [64]. In another novel strategy, the N protein was expressed in the cytoplasm of Lactococcus lactis bacterium and the N-expressing bacteria were administered to mice by intranasal or oral route [65]. In this case, significant levels of N-specific IgG in the mice sera were detected, suggesting that the engineered bacteria may serve as a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV [65].
Although immunization with inactivated viral vaccine provides significant protection in animals against challenge with certain corresponding pathogenic CoVs, in the case of SARS-CoV there remains the threat of introducing live virus into the environment from partially inactivated vaccine, as there are no validated and effective inactivation measures developed yet. To circumvent this obstacle, Chen et al have introduced the S protein into the deletion III region of the live, attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector [66]. This recombinant virus elicits potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys and the major epitope is mapped to the virus receptor-binding region [66]. In another approach, it has been demonstrated that co-expression of SARS-CoV S, M and N expression plasmids in human 293T cells result in the formation of SARS-CoV pseudoparticles (virus-like particles or VLPs) [67]. These findings help us understand the viral morphogenesis as well as offer a safer alternative to using live, replicating SARS virus in the development of vaccines.
The third possibility is a genetically engineered version of live SARS-CoV for traits such as attenuated phenotype, increased immunogenicity, and safe handling (out of BL3+ facility). A full-length SARS-CoV cDNA-containing plasmid has been developed from which synthetic infectious viral RNA can be produced [28]. This system allows for the functional analysis of each gene in the context of infection and can be used for making attenuated strains for vaccine development.
SARS-CoV clearly has pandemic potential. Although progress in SARS-CoV molecular and cell biology research has been remarkable, there remain clear limitations regarding vaccine development due to a lack of complete understanding in the areas of animal models of the disease as well as host immune responses to the evolving molecular diversity of this newly emerged human virus. Caution is warranted when utilizing experimental data originating from one SARS-CoV strain infection in one animal species or cell line in the development of a human vaccine. The rapid development of an effective SARS-CoV vaccine depends upon continuing basic research.
A study on the evolving S protein molecular diversity in SARS-CoV isolates and its unexpected profound immuno-functional effects illustrates this point [68]. The S protein exhibited minor genetic diversity among 8 strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003. Synthetic versions of these S variants with human preferred codons were tested for 1) their ability to bind the receptor (hACE-2), and 2) their sensitivity to antibody neutralization with viral pseudotypes. In these sets of experiments, substantial functional differences were found in S derived from a Guangdong province case -isolate and two palm civets isolates. Antibodies that neutralized most human isolates-derived S proteins unexpectedly enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus-derived S proteins [68]. This novel observation emphasizes the need to understand the molecular potential of the SARS-CoV genome in developing vaccines to prevent human disease. As mentioned previously, studies also point to the fact that variability in the S protein from early to late disease outbreak stages has been detected [18]. There is a large gap in our understanding of how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell and the rapidly changing genome of SARS-CoV indicates the potential variability of such interactions [25]. Development of successful vaccines against SARS virus therefore depends on the progress we make in these areas in the immediate future.

16. Individual sequences in large sets of gene sequences may be distinguished efficiently by combinations of shared sub-sequences
In contemporary biological research, organisms are often identified by firstly sequencing one or more of their genes and then comparing the sequences with those of known species, either by inferring phylogenies or by database searches [1]. Once a sequence is available it may be used to design oligonucleotide probes, and these are used for most routine DNA diagnostic work, because probe hybridisation tests are far less expensive and less technically complex than sequence analysis. Specific oligonucleotide probes are used that are complementary in sequence to, and hence hybridise with, selected regions of the DNA, RNA or cDNA of the target species or genotype. Most such routine tests aim to identify specimens of a single species, or only a very few. Each probe is at least 18 nucleotides long and often twice as long, and is chosen so that it is unique and only hybridises with a single target. As a result, at least one specific probe is required for every target, although usually several different probes are used for each. In some tests, sets of species- or genotype-specific probes are deposited as arrays on solid supports, so that it is possible to check simultaneously if an unknown organism belongs to one or other of many different taxa or genotypes; this strategy is widely used for gene expression analysis. 'High density arrays' of such probes have been used on occasion for identifying pathogens [2], but they are not used routinely because, like sequence analysis, they are costly and technically complex [3], nonetheless the potential market for identifying pathogens in this way is very large (see Discussion).
By contrast, in traditional taxonomy, specimens are rarely identified using characters specific for an individual target, but, instead, by using combinations of characters shared by different members of a set of target organisms. In practice the characters are used to devise a series of presence/absence questions arranged as a 'dichotomous taxonomic key', so that answering these questions sequentially leads to the identification of a specimen. The main advantage of this strategy is that far fewer characters and questions are required to uniquely identify an individual target. The strategy is most efficient when each character bisects the targets into two equal groups, i.e. it is bisectionally distributed, and when different characters bisect the targets differently, ideally in a progressively binary way. In theory the minimum number of characters required to distinguish a finite number of targets by this method is defined by the binary logarithm X = log2Y, where X is the number of characters and Y is the number of targets. For example, ten ideal characters would, in theory, identify each of a set of 1024 targets, and only 20 ideal characters could identify more than a million targets; 1013 and 1,048,555 fewer tests respectively than using target-specific characters.
Using target-specific characters (i.e. one specific character for each target) is the least efficient strategy for identification when efficiency is measured as the number of characters required to identify a target. Using combinations of shared bisectionally-distributed characters can be much more efficient. The use of such shared characters is most efficient when they separate the targets in a progressively binary way.
In this paper we report that gene sequences contain sub-sequences that are present in quasi-randomly distributed sets of around half of the sequences, and hence their presence or absence could be used like the questions in a traditional taxonomic key. These sub-sequences could be detected by sets of probes with complementary sequences. A suitable set of such 'combinatorial probes' could be used to uniquely identify different individual DNAs as these would give different patterns of hybridisation, 'fingerprints', with different individual DNAs Sub-sequences that are suitable targets for probe combinations are most commonly 6–30 nts long. Sub-sequences of such lengths are not unique to the set of target genes, and so the target genes must first be separated from other 'contaminating' DNAs. Various physical or chemical techniques could be used to isolate the target sequences, but perhaps the most convenient would be by PCR using target region-specific primer mixtures (i.e. 'redundant' primers).
Attempts have been made to use algorithms based on suffix trees to find sub-sequences that could be used in combinations to distinguish between gene sequences [4], and others have used selection algorithms based on entropy maximisation [5,6] or on Lagrangian relaxation [6] to optimise probe selection. These studies focussed on the algorithmics of probe selection and demonstrated that sets of sub-sequences 5–8 nts long could distinguish individual sequences. Probes that are only 5 to 8 nts long are not widely used because they usually require unusual hybridisation conditions. In the work reported here we looked at a range of sub-sequence lengths and used a simple greedy algorithm, where sub-sequences were successively chosen that merely maximised the number of pairs of gene-sequences that were distinguished; the algorithm was based on suffix arrays because they use less computer memory than suffix trees to manipulate as large sets. Our study focussed on understanding the effect of gene-sequence diversity on the number and diversity of sub-sequences of different lengths that might be targeted by probes, as these factors will affect their use in practical applications. Here we report a study of three published sets of cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (CO-1) genes from representative groups of animal species [7,8]. These data were chosen because each set is consistent in length and composition, but differs greatly from the others in phylogenetic range and diversity. We have also studied, in less detail, several sets of sequences of plant and animal viruses and the ribosomal genes of bacteria.
It was assumed that two test sequences could be distinguished if one of them contained a sub-sequence and the other did not, even if the second contained a sub-sequence that differed from one in the first at only one position, as hybridisation methods to distinguish such sequences are well established for the assay of single nucleotide polymorphisms [10,11]. To find sub-sequences that could be used like questions in a taxonomic key we searched among those that were shared and bisectionally distributed. We excluded specific sub-sequences, namely sub-sequences that were singletons, and also all sub-sequences found in all the test sequence set. Therefore, the search was confined to "distinguishing sub-sequences" (DSSs), namely those that were present in at least two test-sequences but not present in all the test-sequences.
Distinguishing sub-sequences (DSSs) constituted, at most, 15% of the sub-sequences in the pools from each CO1 sequence set (Fig. 1). Almost all nucleotide combinations up to 6 nucleotides (nts) long were present in all the sequences and, as they were uninformative and therefore eliminated, the percentage of DSSs tended towards zero for lengths less than 6 nts. The proportion of DSSs increased in pools of longer sub-sequences, but the number of singletons also increased with length, and so as sub-sequence length increased the percentage of DSSs in the sub-sequence pool peaked and then decreased. The position of the peak depended on sequence variation; the peak was found at lengths of 8 or 9 nts in pools from the random sequences, and at 9, 10 and 20 nts in those from the CO1-animal, CO1-insect and CO1-moth sequences respectively. Only a few short sub-sequences were repeated within any one sequence and so these had only a minor effect on the size of the DSS pool.
Plots of the number of DSSs in each 'occupancy' category, namely the percentage of test-sequences in which each DSS occurred, showed large variations between the datasets (Fig. 2A &2B), and this mostly reflected the diversity of the sequences. Whereas the CO1-moth set yielded DSSs with 50% occupancy over the complete range of lengths tested, the CO1-insect sequences yielded none longer than 17 nts, and the CO1-animal sequences yielded none longer than 7 nts. In general, as the length increased so the number of DSSs in each occupancy category declined at approximately a negatively exponential rate, but there were large variations between the datasets. For all pools, most DSSs were present in fewer than 10% of the sequences and singletons were most common in pools of the longest DSSs, especially from the diverse CO1-animal data.
Sets of DSSs that, in combination, would distinguish between test sequences were selected. A set of DSSs that could distinguish all the test-sequences in a dataset, in a manner like a taxonomic key, was considered a "complete set". A minimum complete set (MC-set) was defined as a set that contained the fewest DSS found by a random trajectory method (see Methods). Table 1 gives a MC-set for the CO1-moth sequences, and Table 2 gives the 'DSS signatures', binary barcodes or 'fingerprints' for some representative moths.
MC-sets obtained from twenty searches each of the CO1-animal, CO1-insect and CO1-moth data consisted of only 9, 8 and 11 sub-sequences respectively (Fig. 3). In theory, 7 DSSs behaving in a perfectly dichotomous way would be required to distinguish all the sequences in the CO1-animal and CO1-insect data, and the CO1-moth data should require 8 DSSs. Thus, the MC-sets of the shortest DSSs were close to the theoretically predicted size. However, as DSS length and sequence diversity increased, so too did the sizes of the MC-sets. The increase was smoothly curvilinear with the random data, but more variable with real sequences. The more diverse sequences usually required larger MC-sets, although the greater size of the CO1-moth dataset also increased the MC-set size.
Each of the DSS pools was shown to contain several independent equally parsimonious MC-sets by successively excluding MC-sets from the pools and searching the depleted pools for new MC-sets. When this was done using the CO1-animal data and DSSs 8 nts long, the first MC-set was of 11 DSSs, but it was not until eight MC-sets had been successively removed that the MC-set size increased to 12. During the removal process the average occupancy of the DSSs in the MC-sets steadily declined from a mean of 40.2% (range 48% to 18%) to 29.7% (range 40% to 3%) When several MC-sets were obtained using the random DSS choice method and compared, it was clear that many DSSs from different MC-sets were interchangeable.
The relative efficiency of each DSS within a complete set was assessed by calculating the percentage of sequence pairs it distinguished, from among those remaining to be distinguished when it was chosen. In this way, it was found that relative efficiency depended on whether suitable DSSs were available for selection, so whereas the first DSS selected from the CO1-animal sub-sequences 6 nts long was able to distinguish 50% of the sequences, the first DSSs that were 10 nts and 14 nts long only distinguished 41% and 28% of the sequences respectively (Fig. 4A &4B).
Our search method also allows groups of the sequences to be defined, so that the resulting MC-sets only contain DSSs that distinguished between members of different groups of sequences, but not necessarily between sequences of the same group. This enabled, for example, the 96 different CO1-animal sequences to be grouped into seven phyla (e.g. Chordata, Annelida, Nematoda, etc) but this only decreased the size of the MC-set for DSSs six nts long from 9 to 8 DSSs, and for DSS 12 nts long from 26 to 23. However grouping was more valuable for sequence sets containing many nearly identical variant sequences. For example a set of sequences from 240 isolates of Potyvirus, a genus of plant viruses, gave MC-sets of 22, 38 and 50 DSSs with sub-sequences 7, 10 and 12 nts long respectively, but when the sequences were grouped as the 62 recognized species the MC-sets were less than half the size; only 10, 14 and 19 DSSs respectively.
The search method took 54 seconds to select an MC-set of 16 DSS 20 nts long from the 201 CO1-moth sequences when using one processor on a dual Opteron 242 processor machine running at 1.6 GHz. The same system took 13 seconds to select an MC-set of 17 DSSs 10 nts long from the 96 CO1-animal sequences. These tasks took 8 minutes 14 seconds and 85 seconds respectively in a PC with a Pentium CPU at 2.4 GHz. A version of the program is available for use for research purposes over the Internet, contact the corresponding author (MJG) for details.
All the studies described above in which the three sets of CO1 sequences were compared, illustrate the fact that the number of DSSs in a set of sequences is mostly determined by its diversity and by the length of the sub-sequences being sought. Short sub-sequences for probe targeting could readily be found, but longer sub-sequences that would be more useful for identification in standard hybridisation reactions were less common and more likely to be found among closely related, well conserved, gene sequences. The most useful sub-sequences for identification were, as predicted, those that were present in about half of the targets (i.e. those with occupancy scores of about 50%). Most gene sub-sequences less than 18 nts long are not unique to particular genes. Therefore they can only be used as targets for diagnostic tests when the target nucleic acids that contain them have been preselected in some way. This could be accomplished most conveniently by PCR using region-specific primers or primer mixtures.
One advantage of combining region-specific amplification with identification using combinatorial probes is that related but previously unrecognised or uncharacterised species or subtypes may be found. The chosen region, even from unknown species or subtypes, is likely to be amplified using the region-specific primers or primer mixture, and it is then also likely that the combinatorial probes will hybridise with at least some of the target sub-sequences, but will give DSS 'signatures' that have not been seen before. This is because each MC-set that we have found is many-fold redundant, and has the potential to generate many more different signatures than would be generated from the known test-sequences. For example, the MC-sets 18 nucleotides long that distinguished the 201 CO1-moth sequences were of 16 DSSs. Sixteen DSSs could, if they behaved in a perfectly dichotomous way, uniquely identify 65,536 different gene sequences or species (i.e. 216). Thus the MC-sets we found were 99.7% redundant, and the combinations of DSSs not represented among the target sequences would be available to distinguish previously unknown variants of the selected gene region.
The aim of the work reported in this paper was to investigate the factors that influenced the numbers of sub-sequences that, in combination, could distinguish sequences or groups thereof. We therefore tested our selection algorithm using three published sets of CO1 sequences that were consistent in length and composition, but differed greatly from one another in phylogenetic range and diversity. We have also examined, but in less detail, a set of ribosomal RNA genes from 17 bacterial species representing 12 genera and also gene sequences from several groups of animal and plant viruses, namely flaviviruses, orthomyxoviruses, potyviruses and tobamoviruses (unpublished results). The results obtained with the bacterial and viral sequences did not differ in any significant way from those obtained with CO1 sequences, which suggests that there is no a priori reason to believe that DSSs for targeting by probe combinations are not present in all genes.
The design of practical diagnostic tests, based on the principles outlined in this paper, would involve several stages. First, known sequences of potential targets would be examined to find regions of convenient length and variability bracketed by conserved sites for PCR primers. The region-specific primers would be tested and optimised using a range of variant sequences. Then all known sequences of the region would be used to identify MC-sets of DSSs, whose complements could be used as probes in hybridisation-based tests to identify individual variants. However an iterative process will be required to design a working set of combinatorial probes as it is well known that a significant proportion of sub-sequences selected as hybridisation probes fail to behave as expected because of secondary structures in the target nucleic acid or the probe [12]. First an initial MC-set would be selected bioinformatically, then tested biochemically, and the probes that performed correctly used as a 'starter set' for further rounds of bioinformatic and biochemical selection, until a working MC-set was obtained. When this DSS set is used in practice, variant sequences giving unknown DSS signatures are likely to be found. These would then be sequenced and added to the trainer set, and the MC-set might have to be redesigned.
The value of target-specific 'high-density microarrays' of DNA probes was most spectacularly demonstrated when the pathogen causing SARS was shown to be a coronavirus. It was detected using an array of about 10,000 different oligonucleotides from some of the most conserved regions of about 1,000 reference viral genomes [2,13,14]. However, the microarrays used for SARS were not standard diagnostic tools, and high-density microarrays are also not used routinely in infectious disease diagnostics because of their cost and complexity [3]. Nonetheless multiplexing offers clear benefits [15] as more information is provided by each test.
At present non-multiplexed tests or tests that use just a few specific probes are the standard. These tests are used routinely for screening donor blood for viruses, including human immunodeficiency lentiviruses and hepatitis C hepaciviruses, and as the primary or confirmatory diagnostic tests for sexually transmitted pathogens and pathogens that cause meningitis [3,16-20]. These nucleic acid probe-based medical diagnostics have a very large market value [21].
Probes, which identify by being used in combinations, could be most usefully used in low-density DNA microarrays. Low-density microarrays typically comprise fewer than 100 probes and often fewer than 40 probes, and it seems likely that such microarrays could outperform high-density microarrays for routine diagnostic applications because of their reliability, simpler data analysis and much lesser cost [22-24]. Different combinatorial probe sets could be combined in each low-density array to achieve greater redundancy and accuracy; they might not merely replicate one another but could optimally target different major organism groups or different epidemiologically important strains with each replicate MC-set [19,25].
This paper reports a method that finds sub-sequences which, in combinations, distinguish the individual gene sequences or groups of gene sequences from which they came, and that could be used as targets for DNA probes. Sequence diversity and sub-sequence length were found to be the major factors influencing the number of sub-sequences available as probe targets.
Three previously described datasets of CO1 sequences [7,8] were used, although certain sequences were not included either because they could not be retrieved from GenBank, or they were incomplete. The CO1-animal data was from 96 species of animals and lacks sequences AF310721, AJ271612, NC_002767 and AF370851 in the reported set; the CO1-insect data was from 92 species of insects and lacks sequences NC_003372, AY165779, AF146683, AB010925, NC_001566, NC_002084, NC_000857 and NC_001322, and the CO1-moth data was from 201 species of Lepidoptera. The sequences were aligned using Clustal X [9] with the default parameters, and the region providing the 'test sequences' was that bounded by the semi-conserved sequences 5'-GTNGGNACNGCNNT-3' and 5'-GGNGGNGGNGAYCC-3', which are potential gene specific PCR primer sites. Random sequence datasets were constructed that matched the length and average nucleotide composition of each test-sequence dataset.
Sets of sub-sequences that could distinguish the test-sequences were found using research programs written in Lahey Fortran 95. Test-sequences were degapped, and then every test-sequence in a dataset was initially converted into a pool of all the possible overlapping sub-sequences of a chosen length that it contained. Pools of sub-sequences of different lengths, ranging from 6 to 31 nucleotides (nts), were analysed separately. The uninformative sub-sequences that were discarded were singletons, replicates and sub-sequences found in all the test-sequences.
Sets of DSSs that, in combination, would distinguish between test sequences were selected by a "greedy algorithm". First, an array was constructed that recorded the DSSs in each test-sequence. A "distinguishing array" was then constructed that recorded for every pair of test-sequences, the DSSs that distinguished the pair. A "distinguishing-score" was then calculated for each DSS by summing the number of pairs of test-sequences that it distinguished. The DSS with the largest distinguishing-score was chosen. This DSS and the pairs that it distinguished were then eliminated from the distinguishing array. The process of DSS selection was then repeated either until a set of DSSs had been found that, in combination, distinguished all the test-sequences, or until no DSS could be found that would distinguish the remaining test-sequences. The set of DSSs that could distinguish all the test-sequences, was considered a "complete set". The ability of a complete set to distinguish the test-sequences in a dataset was independently confirmed by using a separate program to search the test-sequences for every DSS in the set, and by checking that the resulting pattern of its presence/absence, its "DSS signature", was unique.
During most searches, the greatest distinguishing score at each step of the search was achieved by more than one DSS, so one was chosen at random from among those with the greatest score at each step of the search for a complete set. This allowed a search to have a random trajectory through a succession of DSS choices, and often produced MC-sets of different sizes for the DSSs of the same length; the smallest were sometimes 3 DSSs smaller than the largest.
To aid the discovery of probe sets for different applications, options were included in the programs that permitted: (i) the exclusion of particular DSSs from the minimum set, (ii) inclusion of particular DSSs in the minimum set, (iii) exclusion of DSSs that, as double-stranded DNA, would 'melt' outside a chosen temperature range [26,27], and (iv) the exclusion of DSSs with runs of more than a defined number of consecutive residues of the same nucleotide.

17. Absence of association between angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphism and development of adult respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: a case control study
The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has made a great impact to the health care systems around the world. The pandemic affected over 8000 individuals and resulted in 774 deaths worldwide [1]. Several clinical parameters, including male sex [2,3], age of over 60 years [2,3], elevated lactate dehydrogenase activity [2-4], low platelet count [2] and high viral load on presentation [5], have been identified to be predictive of the severity of the disease in affected individuals. Moreover, it has been postulated that genetic variations of the host and the virus may account for the individual difference in the susceptibility to the infection and the severity of the disease. With regard to viral factors, it has been shown that there is no significant difference in the genetic sequences of viruses causing the two major outbreaks in Hong Kong, namely the Prince of Wales Hospital and Amoy Gardens outbreaks, despite the significant difference in the mortality rates and diarrheal rates of the two cohorts [6]. Furthermore, several association studies have been conducted to investigate the possible contribution of host genetic factors in the determination of the susceptibility and prognosis of SARS-coronavirus infection. Thus, certain human leukocyte antigen subtypes have been shown to be more prevalent in SARS patients [7] and in those who had poorer outcomes [8]. On the other hand, the polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme II gene, coding for a functional receptor of the SARS-coronavirus, is not associated with the susceptibility or outcome of SARS [9]. Recently, it has also been reported that the deletion of the 287 bp Alu repeat (D allele) in intron 16 of the ACE gene is associated with hypoxemia in SARS patients [10]. However, there are several limitations to this previous study. First, only 44 SARS patients were studied. Second, hypoxemia was arbitrarily defined as requiring oxygen supplementation. Moreover, patients who died were excluded from the study. These factors may be potential confounders to a genetic association study.
Therefore, in this study, we investigated the association of the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the 287 bp Alu repeat to the susceptibility to SARS and the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a larger population.
This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. Patients who were admitted to the hospitals of the New Territories East cluster of Hong Kong for the treatment of SARS were recruited retrospectively. The recruitment of patients depended on the availability of blood samples. All patients, including survivors and deceased patients, with available blood samples were recruited. For genetically related SARS patients, only the index case (the first individual who developed symptoms) was recruited. All patients were of Chinese ethnicity and fulfilled the World Health Organisation case definition of probable SARS [11]. Three hundred and twenty-six healthy individuals undergoing routine health check were recruited as controls. The control subjects were recruited before the SARS epidemic and none of them had respiratory symptoms. All control subjects were ethnical Chinese and were not genetically related.
The association between genotype and disease outcome was studied in the SARS patients. Two categories of patients were considered as having a severe disease: (1) patients who developed ARDS; and (2) patients who required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). A patient was classified as having ARDS if he or she fulfilled all criteria of the joint American/European Consensus for ARDS [12], including: (1) acute onset of respiratory distress; (2) presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray; (3) having a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fractional oxygen concentration (PaO2/FiO2) of less than 26.8 kPa and absence of clinical evidence of left heart failure.
DNA was extracted from whole blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) with the 'Blood and Body Fluid Spin protocol' as recommended by the manufacturer. ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The forward and reverse primers were 5'-CTGGAGACCACTCCCATCCTTTCT-3' and 5'-GATGTGGCCATCACATTCGTCAGAT-3', respectively. Reactions were set up in a volume of 25 μl containing 0.1 μM of each primer, 1X buffer II (Applied Biosystems), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.25 U Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, Applied Biosystems) and 20 ng DNA. After initial denaturation at 95°C for 12 min, the reaction mixtures were subjected to 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 58°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. This method yielded amplification products of 480 bp for the I allele and 192 bp for the D allele. The products were electrophoresed and visualized in 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide.
Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat, Ver. 3.0; SPSS. Disease associations were compared by chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of ARDS or the outcome of SARS.
One hundred and forty SARS patients (67 males, 73 females) and 326 healthy individuals (172 males, 154 females) were recruited. The mean ages of the SARS patients and control subjects were 39.9 and 42.5 years, respectively (p = 0.93). Seventeen of the 140 SARS patients developed ARDS during the course of their illness. The demographic data of the SARS patients who had or had not developed ARDS are summarized in table 1. Patients who developed ARDS were significantly older than those who did not develop ARDS (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in gender, smoking habits, hepatitis B status and the presence of comorbidity between the two groups. Thirty-five patients required intensive care and sixteen died. Patients who required intensive care were significantly older than those with milder disease.
The genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism in the SARS patients and control subjects are shown in table 2. The genotypic distributions of the SARS patients and the healthy control subjects follow the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using chi-square analysis. There was no significant difference in the genotypic distributions (χ2 value = 1.43, df = 2, p = 0.489) and allelic frequencies (χ2 value = 0.000624, df = 1, p = 0.980) of the two groups. Among the SARS patients, we further analyzed the genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism in patients who developed ARDS and in those who did not develop ARDS in the course of their illness. The results are shown in table 3a. There was no significant difference in the genotypic distributions (χ2 value = 4.361, df = 2, p = 0.113) and allelic frequencies (χ2 value = 1.376, df = 1, p = 0.241) between the two groups. Besides, there was also no significant difference in the genotypic distributions (χ2 value = 2.489, df = 2, p = 0.288) and allelic frequencies (χ2 value = 1.424, df = 1, p = 0.233) between patients who did or did not require intensive care. The results are shown in table 3b.
In the univariate analysis, we did not detect any significant difference in the number of D alleles in the ACE polymorphism between patients who did and did not develop ARDS (p = 0.169, OR = 0.549 (95% CI: 0.23–1.29). Following multivariate logistic regression analysis, age was found to be the only significant factor that determined the development of ARDS in SARS patients (table 4a). In the multivariate analysis for the requirement of intensive care, we have shown that age and male sex are associated with the requirement of intensive care (table 4b).
The possible contribution of host genetic factors to the susceptibility and outcome of SARS-coronavirus infection has been investigated through several association studies [7-10]. In contrast to a recent report showing an association between the presence of the D allele of the ACE gene and hypoxemia in SARS patients [10], we have shown that the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with neither increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection nor progression to ARDS once infected. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we have identified that age is the only significant factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independently associated with the requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. Our findings are consistent with other published reports [2,3].
There are several possible explanations for the discrepancies in our conclusion and that by Itoyama et al [10] concerning the association between ACE polymorphism and the outcome of SARS. First, the inclusion of subjects within the same family and exclusion of deceased patients by the previous study might cause potential bias, especially when the frequency of the DD genotype was reported to be as low as 6% in control subjects [10]. In this study, we have only included the index patient if more than one member in a family developed SARS. Second, we have used a well defined endpoint of ARDS instead of the requirement of supplemental oxygen. SARS infection commonly leads to respiratory distress and over 80% of patients were given supplemental oxygen during the course of their illness in our cohort. Therefore, it seems to be more appropriate to use ARDS instead of the requirement of oxygen supplement to define the severity of SARS. As ARDS is the more severe end of the spectrum of disease progression, any potential association between genotype and disease progression would become even more obvious when the most severe cases were considered. Similarly, the disease outcome was not associated with ACE I/D genotype when we also used another broader definition for severe disease after SARS infection (requiring intensive care or death).
Previous studies on Caucasian populations have suggested that the presence of the D allele of the ACE gene is associated with increased incidence of ARDS [13]. This effect has been postulated to be related to the higher enzyme activity in individuals with DD genotype [15]. However, it is unclear whether these observations can also be seen in Chinese as the frequencies of DD genotype and D allele of the ACE gene are much lower in Chinese than in Caucasian subjects [13,16]. Furthermore, the SARS-coronavirus characteristically affects the pneumocytes, and the formation of multinucleated pneumocytes and intrabronchial fibrogranulation (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like lesions) are commonly observed in the lung biopsies of SARS patients in addition to the typical pathological changes of ARDS [17]. Therefore, it is possible that the pathogenesis and genetic factors predisposing to SARS-related ARDS may be different from ARDS resulted from other respiratory illnesses.
Previous reports have highlighted the inconsistency of the results of genetic association studies for complex diseases [18,19]. This inconsistency may be attributable to the difference in the genetic composition of the studied population and study design. Here, we showed that both susceptibility and disease outcome of SARS infection were not associated with ACE I/D polymorphism among Chinese patients in contrast to the recent report studying Vietnamese patients [10]. The sample size was definitively larger in our study. Two different better-defined criteria were used as indicators of severe disease progression, yet no association was found between disease severity and ACE I/D genotype. The D allele which was the hypothetical high risk allele [13], did not show any sign of over-representation in the subgroups of patients with severe disease.
Our analysis indicates that ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection in Chinese.

18. GIDEON: a comprehensive Web-based resource for geographic medicine
As of 2005, the world is confronted by 338 generic infectious diseases, scattered in a complex fashion across over 220 countries and regions. Each new day confronts health care workers with unexpected outbreaks, epidemics and heretofore unknown pathogens. Over 2,000 named bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites are known to cause human disease; and are confronted by 328 anti-infective agents and vaccines. Experts working in Health Geographics share an obvious and immediate need for comprehensive and timely data on the status of infection around the globe. A recent outline of GIDEON addressed uses for the Infectious Diseases clinician [1]. This review will focus on the Global Health aspect of the program.
In 1990, we initiated a project to design computer systems to follow all diseases, outbreaks, pathogens and drugs. The initial DOS-based program was written in Paradox for floppy disks, later evolving through a compact disk-based program in Windows. A commercial web-based program was eventually released under the name, GIDEON (Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology ON-line, Gideon Informatics, Inc, Los Angeles, California) at . The current version is available on CD (updated every three months) or web subscription (updated every week).
The program consists of four modules: Diagnosis, Epidemiology, Therapy and Microbiology. Program modules of peripheral interest in Health Geographics (Therapy and Microbiology) will be discussed only briefly.
The Diagnosis module is designed to generate a ranked differential diagnosis based on signs, symptoms, laboratory tests, incubation period, nature of exposure and country of disease origin. Figure 1 depicts the data entry screen for a patient suffering from fever and joint pain following a trip to Indonesia. The lower 'Personal notes' box is used to record additional case data, and can be written in the user's own language. The differential diagnosis list for this case (figure 2) indicates that this patient may be suffering from Chikungunya. The appearance of many diseases on the list indicates that the user failed to enter all positive, and negative findings. For example, the fact that cough was absent would have reduced the likelihood of the second disease listed (Mycoplasma infection) and increased the statistical probability of Chikungunya.
At this point, the user can generate a hard copy or e-mail report, access a table comparing the clinical features of the diseases listed, or examine the ranking or omission of specific diseases. If the user clicks on a specific disease name, clinical and epidemiological data on the disease in question are depicted (figure 3). The differential diagnosis list is generated by a Bayesian formula which compares the product of disease-incidence and symptom incidence, for all compatible infectious diseases. In the above example, a number of diseases known to occur in Indonesia were capable of producing fever, and joint pain. The statistical likelihood of Chikungunya in this case can be computed by a simple Bayesian formula, as follows:

C = Chikungunya, P = probability or incidence, S = observed symptoms
P-(C/S) = probability of Chikungunya, given these symptoms
D2, D3, Dn = other diseases compabible with this clinical scenario
Two spreadsheets in the GIDEON database respectively follow the incidence of all symptoms for every disease, and the incidence of all diseases for every country. When a clinical case is "entered" into GIDEON, the program identifies all compatible diseases and ranks their relative likelihoods as determined by the above formula, ie: P-(C/S) vs. P-(D2/S) vs. P-(D3/S) ... vs. P-(Dn/S).
A blinded study of 500 cases conducted by this author found that the correct diagnosis was listed in the differential list in 94.7% of cases, and was ranked first in 75% [2]. A second study of hospitalized patients in Boston found that the correct diagnosis was listed in only 69%, and was ranked first in 60% [3]. It is likely that inclusion in the differential diagnosis list may be more important than disease ranking in such systems [4].
A "Bioterrorism" option generates the differential diagnosis for diseases associated with suspected bioterror scenarios. In Figure 4, "<bioterrorism simulator>" has been substituted for Indonesia, given the above constellation of fever, joint pain, etc. The resulting differential diagnosis lists Ebola (42.9% probability), followed by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (12.6% probability). A similar "Worldwide" option can be used to explore all of the worlds diseases consistent with given clinical features, and access text on the global status for individual diseases.
In theory, data entry by users can be monitored at the server level for purposes of surveillance. For example, if one or more users in China were to enter cases of fatal pneumonia, a "red-flag" at any monitoring agency (i.e., the World Health Organization) could indicate the possible appearance of SARS – long before submission of specimens or reporting of the case to local authorities. Similarly, the appearance of multiple cases of "dysentery" by users in a given community could indicate a possible outbreak of shigellosis.
The Epidemiology module presents detailed country-specific information on the status of each disease, both globally and within each relevant country. The current version contains over two million words in 12,000 notes. All data are derived from Health Ministry publications, peer-review journals, standard textbooks, WHO and CDC websites and data presented at conferences. The user may also access over 30,000 graphs which follow disease incidence, rates and other numerical data. The main Epidemiology screen is shown in Figure 5. Note that the user can append custom "personal notes" – in any national language or font- regarding the status of every disease in their own institution. Such notes would be accessible by all colleagues using GIDEON on the local network.
Maps which depict the global distribution of each disease can be accessed through the 'Distribution' tab (Figure 6). Text outlining country-specific data for the disease (Figure 7) is available through either a list of countries displayed in this module, or by clicking the relevant 'red dot' on the map. These text boxes also include data sets which automatically generate incidence / rate graphs (Figure 8), a chronological account of all disease outbreaks, and numbered reference links to relevant journal publications and reports of ongoing outbreaks from ProMed . A separate 'Graphs' option allows the user to generate custom-made graphs comparing multiple disease rates, or rates in multiple countries. (Figure 9).
Additional tabs access the descriptive epidemiology and clinical background of each disease. Synonym tabs generate lists of alternative terms for diseases and countries in Spanish, German, Norwegian, etc. Historical data record the incidence of individual diseases and significant outbreaks spanning decades. An additional "Fingerprint" option generates a list of diseases compatible with any set of epidemiological parameters. For example, in Figure 10 we see that ten parasitic diseases are transmitted by fish in Japan.
The Therapy module follows the pharmacology and application of all drugs and vaccines used in Infectious Diseases. The current version contains 264 generic drugs and 64 vaccines. Various sub-modules present the mechanism of action; pharmacology, dosages, drug-drug interactions, contraindications, spectrum, and susceptibility testing standards. An international synonym lists contains over 9,500 trade names. As in other modules, users may add custom notes in their own language for each drug or vaccine: prices, resistance patterns, local trade names, etc.
The Microbiology option is similar to the Diagnosis module. Users may enter any combination of phenotypic tests, and obtain a ranked probability list of compatible bacteria. The current version incorporates more than 1,300 taxa. The Microbiology module is also designed to list the phenotype, prior names, ecology and disease association for any organism, or compare the phenotypes of any combination of organisms selected by the user.
Since the graphic and mapping functions of GIDEON treat individual countries as whole units, data presentations lack a certain degree of "granularity." Thus, the differential diagnosis of fever in Venezuela will include malaria, even if the patient is living outside of the endemic, southern region. This problem is corrected to a large extent by text in the associated country-specific notes and the general knowledge base of the treating physician. In theory, the manufacturer could follow the incidence of each disease for every state, district, province and oblast; but variability would still exist according to occupation, rural vs. urban setting, season, etc.
An additional problem relates to the availability and quality of valid epidemiological data. Disease reporting varies widely from country to country. For example, AIDS reporting statistics from sub-Saharan Africa are generally inadequate. Where necessary, the spreadsheets used by GIDEON record published true estimates rather than questionable reports. In other instances, Health Ministry data conflict with reports of the World Health Organisation, a fact which is recorded in relevant GIDEON country notes. Occasionally, major diseases are not reported at all. For example, several recent cases of cholera in Japan originated from Thailand; but Thailand has not officially reported a single case in many years. Where possible, the GIDEON data base relies on published best estimates, and at times 'educated guesses' when data are entirely lacking. Thus, there are few published data for disease incidence in Togo, and the program is forced to rely on publications for neighboring Ghana.

19. Intracellular localization of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) virus glycoproteins
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a member of the genus Nairovirus, one of five genera in the family Bunyaviridae [1]. Bunyaviruses are enveloped particles with a tripartite, single stranded RNA genome of negative polarity [2-4]. The three genome segments encode four structural proteins: the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein) is encoded by the large (L) segment, the glycoproteins (GN and GC; previously referred to as G1 and G2) are encoded by the medium (M) segment, and the nucleocapsid protein (N) is encoded by the small (S) segment [2-4].
The virus glycoproteins are likely to play an important role in the natural tick-vertebrate cycle of the virus as well as for the high pathogenicity in humans. Indeed, a highly variable mucin-like region at the amino terminus of the CCHFV glycoprotein precursor has recently been identified, a unique feature of nairoviruses within the family Bunyaviridae [5]. A similar serine-threonine-rich domain has been associated with increased vascular permeability and development of hemorrhages in Ebola hemorrhagic fever [6].
The Nairovirus genus includes 34 described viruses and is divided into seven different serogroups [1]. Only three viruses are known to cause disease: CCHFV, Dugbe virus, and Nairobi sheep disease virus. CCHFV is an arthropod-borne pathogen and the causative agent of a serious form of hemorrhagic fever [7-9] with mortality rates ranging from 15 to 60% [10-17]. The virus is endemic in parts of Africa, Southeastern Europe and Asia as far east as western China [16,18,19]. The geographic distribution of CCHFV infections corresponds most closely with the distribution of Hyalomma ticks, suggesting their principal vector role [18,20,21]. Hyalomma ticks normally feed on a variety of livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, and ostriches), large wild herbivores, hares, and hedgehogs, which can become infected with CCHFV [13,18,22,23]. In contrast to human infections, infection in these animals generally results in inapparent or subclinical disease but generates viremia levels capable of supporting virus transmission to uninfected ticks [10,18,21,23-25]. Transmission to humans occurs either by bites from infected ticks or direct contact with blood or tissues of infected livestock. Nosocomial infections are common [26] and represent a major problem in health care institutions [27].
The widespread geographical distribution of CCHFV, its ability to produce severe human disease with high mortality rates, and fears about its intentional use as a bioterrorism agent  makes CCHFV an extremely important human pathogen and a worldwide public health concern. Case management and intervention strategies would greatly benefit from knowledge of the biology and pathogenesis of the virus.
Recently, the expression strategy and biosynthesis of the CCHFV glycoproteins have been studied in more detail including the identification of precursor cleavage sites and the determination of the exact N termini of the two major cleavage products, GN and GC [5,28]. SKI-1, also responsible for the proteolytic processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor [29], has been identified as the cellular protease responsible for the processing step that generates the N-terminus of mature GN. Another yet unidentified protease is required for GC processing. However, the exact C-terminus of GN could not yet been determined. Two cleavage sites have been predicted for this processing step, one at amino acid position 808 (RKLL) and the other at 940/944 (KKRKK) favouring the cellular proteases SKI-1 and furin, respectively, as the responsible proteases [28].
Bunyaviruses are known to bud from Golgi membranes and the budding site seems to be defined by an retention of the glycoproteins GN and GC at that particular site [3,4]. From a number of studies which have addressed the mechanisms of Golgi targeting and retention, one can conclude that the N-terminal located glycoprotein appears to carry the appropriate signal(s) [30-40] So far, no studies have investigated Golgi targeting and retention of nairovirus glycoproteins.
In this study we cloned the complete M segment ORF of CCHFV, strain IbAr10200, into different expression plasmids. Expression and intracellular localization of the glycoproteins GN and GC were studied and compared to glycoproteins generated by virus infection. Using recombinant fusion proteins between the green fluorescence protein (GFP) and CCHFV glycoproteins, the Golgi targeting/retention signal could be mapped to a hydrophobic region within the cytoplasmic domain of the GN protein.
The complete M segment nucleotide sequences of two different sources of CCHFV, strain IbAr10200, was determined and compared to previously published sequences [GenBank: U39455]. Several nucleotide changes resulting in amino acid changes in the glycoprotein precursor were identified (Table 1). In two different CCHF viral RNA samples eight amino acid changes and two silent nucleotide changes could be detected. Four additional amino acid changes were found in sample #2 as well as four silent nucleotide changes not leading to any amino acid alteration. CCHFV RNA sample #1 showed two additional unique amino acid changes.
Furthermore, we determined the sequences of the exact ends of the M segment using an RNA ligation approach. Beside constructs with nucleotide deletions due to RNA degradation prior to RNA ligation several full-length sequences were determined, demonstrating the expected homologous RNA ends compare to the CCHF S and L segments (Fig. 1). Especially the first and last nine nucleotides of the CCHF M vRNA segment showed high complementarity to the L and S segment ends (bold and italicized nucleotides in Fig. 1), confirming their role as important cis-acting elements for RNA polymerase binding [41,42].
Based on the recently published N-terminal sequence determination of mature CCHFV glycoproteins [5] and using the above described determined CCHFV M segment sequence (sample #1), expression plasmids for both glycoproteins GN and GC as well as for the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) were generated. Since the C-terminus of CCHFV GN has not yet been determined ([28]; S. Nichol: pers. communication) two constructs were generated containing an N-terminal Influenza HA-tag for detection: pCMV CCHF GN "short" (GNs) and pCMV CCHF GN "long" (GNl). Glycoprotein expression was first analyzed by immunoblot using CCHFV-specific polyclonal or HA-tag antibodies. The CCHF full-length glycoprotein precursor construct (pCAGGS CCHFV GPC) was successfully expressed and correctly processed into the cleavage fragments GC and GN (Fig. 2, lane 2). Molecular weights (GC, 37 kDa and GN, 75 kDa) as determined by immunoblot analysis were in accordance with those of the GC and GN expressed in CCHFV-infected VeroE6 cells (Fig. 2, lane 1). CMV-driven HA-GNs and HA-GNl expression resulted in a protein of approximately 75 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4), similar to authentic GN glycoprotein seen in CCHFV-infected cells (Fig. 2, lane 1). Expression of chicken β-actin-driven GC resulted in a product of approximately 37 kDa, again similar to GC expression in CCHV-infected cells (Fig. 2, lane 5). The data demonstrates that each glycoprotein can be authentically expressed individually from separate plasmids (e.g., pCMV GNs, pCMV GNl and pCAGGS GC) as well as from a clone encoding the GPC precursor (pCAGGS GPC) using polyclonal CCHFV-specific and HA-tag antibodies (Fig. 2). Expression could also be confirmed using CCHFV-specific GC and GN antipeptide antibodies which were kindly provided by S. Nichol, CDC) (data not shown).
Indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) were initially performed to analyze the cellular localization of CCHFV glycoproteins. For this, different CCHFV glycoprotein expression plasmids were individually transfected into BHK-21 or 293T cells and 24 to 48 h post transfection the cells were fixed with acetone/methanol or paraformaldehyde for intracellular (Fig. 3A) or surface immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3B), respectively. HA-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the two forms of individually expressed N-terminal HA-tagged GN (Fig. 3A: b, c, g, h) and CCHFV GC-specific antibodies were used to monitor β-actin promoter-driven GC expression products (Fig. 3A: a, f). In addition, a CCHFV-specific antiserum was used to detect GN and GC expression from full-length glycoprotein precursor construct pCAGGS GPC (Fig. 3A: d, i) as well as in CCHFV-infected cells (Fig. 3A: e, j). In all cases GN and GC were detected intracellular but never on the cell surface (Figs. 3A and 3B). Mock-infected and -transfected cells were used as negative controls (data not shown). Two different cell lines were used to exclude artificial cell type-specific localization pattern of CCHFV glycoproteins.
In a next step we tried to specify the intracellular localization of CCHFV GN and GC glycoproteins expressed from plasmids encoding either the individual glycoproteins or the precursor GPC. Intracellular staining pattern of CCHV-infected cells as well as cells expressing the CCHFV precursor GPC revealed a Golgi complex staining pattern independent of the antibodies used for detection of the individual glycoproteins (Fig. 3A: d, e, i, j). Subsequently, we analyzed the intracellular localization of individually expressed GN and GC. Whereas individually expressed GN showed a Golgi complex localization (Fig. 3A: b, c, g, h), individually expressed GC accumulated in the perinuclear region of the cell indicative of ER localization (Fig. 3A: a, f). Confirmation for these results were achieved by co-immunofluorescence analyzed on a confocal microscope using CCHFV glycoprotein-specific or HA-specific antibodies and either antibodies directed against the ER-specific marker molecule calreticulin or direct staining of the Golgi region with BODIPY-TR C5 ceramides (Fig. 4). Again, CCHFV GN expression from the two expression plasmids pCMV GNs and pCMV GNl overlapped with Golgi staining (Fig. 4: e, f), whereas GC expression overlapped with that of calreticulin (Fig. 4: d). However, co-expression of both CCHFV glycoproteins either from the glycoprotein precursor plasmid or from simultaneous transfection of the two expression plasmids resulted in Golgi targeting of both glycoproteins (Fig. 4: c, g) strongly indicating that GN drives the Golgi localization and that GC needs to interact with GN in order to be transported out of the ER.
To further strengthen the association of CCHFV glycoproteins with intracellular membrane-containing compartments such as ER and Golgi complex, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments. This method allows the separation of soluble proteins from membrane-associated proteins. CCHFV-infected cells were used for comparison (Fig. 5: lane 1). As expected all expressed CCHFV glycoproteins were exclusively found in the pellet fractions, which contain membrane-associated proteins. This confirms the intracellular localization of these proteins with membrane structures and together with the co-immunofluorescence data confirms either ER or Golgi localization (Fig. 5: lanes 2 to 5). To evaluate the described approach control experiments using either the soluble CCHFV N proteins or the Golgi marker Mannosidase II were performed. As expected CCHF N protein was exclusively found in the soluble fraction, whereas the Golgi marker protein was only detected in the membrane-associate fraction.
After determining the intracellular localization of the CCHFV glycoproteins, we next were interested to determine the signals for intracellular targeting. For this, we generated GFP-fusion proteins containing different fragments of the GC or GN proteins attached to GFP. On the basis of published data obtained with other bunyaviruses we expected Golgi localization signals rather within the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains than in the ectodomain [3,4]. A CMV-driven GFP expression plasmid (pHL2823, Flick and Hobom, unpublished) was used as a cloning vector for fusing different regions of the CCHFV glycoproteins to the C-terminus of the GFP. Firstly, the different PCR-amplified GN cytoplasmic domain fragments (Table 2) were cleaved with BsmBI and inserted into pHL2823 after BamHI/XbaI endonuclease treatment. In an alternative approach a signal peptide (Ig κ-chain signal of the pDisplay vector) was fused to the GFP N-terminus to allow entry into the secretory pathway. Secondly, the GN transmembrane domain (TM I) was inserted using a hybridized oligonucleotide linker (RF372/RF373: GATCCTTTGGCTATGT AATAACCTGCATACTTTGCAAGGCCATTTTTTACTTGTTAATAATTGTTGGATAAT/ CTAGATTATCCAACAATTATTAACAAGTAAAAAATGGCCTTGCAAAGTATGCAGGTTATTACATAGCCAAAG). The expression of the resulting constructs GFP-GNA, GFP-GNB, GFP-GNC, GFP-GND, GFP-GNE, GFP-GNF, GFP-GNG, GFP-GNH, and GFP-GNI (Fig. 6A) was first verified by immunoblot (data not shown). All constructs expressed GFP-fusion proteins of expected sizes and were subsequently used in co-localization studies. For this two different cell lines (BHK-21 and 293T), for comparison purposes, were transfected with the different plasmid DNAs and GFP fluorescence localization was analyzed using UV-microscopy.
The fusion protein GFP-GNI, containing the TM I of CCHF GN was expressed in the cell cytoplasm in both used cell lines (Figs. 6B and 6C: b) similarly to GFP expressed from the basic vector pHL2823 (Figs. 6B and 6C: a). In case of the signal peptide-containing GFP fusion protein a diffuse staining consistent with the distribution throughout the secretory system was observed (data not shown). Based on this result we conclude that the transmembrane domain TM I does not contain any intracellular targeting signal.
The fusion proteins GFP-GNA and GFP-GNB showed a similar cytoplasmic expression pattern (Figs. 6B and 6C: c, d). GFP-GNA contains the first 87 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain including the RKLL motif at position 808, which is a predicted protease cleavage motif for generating the C-terminus of the mature GN protein, whereas GFP-GNB has 99 amino acids fused to the GFP C-terminus, corresponding to the first GN cytosolic tail fragment, which is followed by a second hydrophobic region predicted as a potential transmembrane domain 2 (TM II) (compare Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the fusion proteins GFP-GNC, GFP-GND, GFP-GNE, GFP-GNF, GFP-GNG, and GFP-GNH, which contain longer fragments of the predicted GN cytoplasmic domain including additional predicted hydrophobic transmembran regions (Fig. 6A), showed an increased level of similarity to the intracellular pattern of GNl, which contained the entire GN cytoplasmic domain up to the determined mature GC start (Figs. 6B and 6C: e-j). The switch from a diffuse staining pattern to a Golgi complex localization is caused by the addition of TM II to the first 99 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain resulting in GFP-fusion proteins containing 122 amino acids of the predicted GN cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 6A). These results demonstrate that the Golgi targeting signal is not located within the first 99 amino acids of the GN cytoplasmic domain. However, the addition of an additional hydrophobic 23 amino acid stretch (TM II) result in a co-localization of the GFP-fusion protein with the Golgi complex marker mannosidase II (Fig. 7), demonstrating that a Golgi localization signal is located within the predicted TM II.
The Golgi localization signal was further analyzed with two more GFP-fusion proteins containing only the 23 amino acids from the predicted TM II directly fused to the C-terminus of GFP. To determine if a specific primary sequence within TM II was recognized as a signal or rather the hydrophobic character of this region was crucial to target GFP to the Golgi complex, the 23 amino acids were fused in two different orientations (Fig. 6A). BHK-21 (Fig. 6B) and 293T (Fig. 6C) cells were transfected with these constructs and GFP expression and intracellular localization were analyzed. Both GFP-fusion proteins showed specific Golgi complex localization demonstrating that TM II contains a Golgi localization signal and that the orientation of the primary amino acid sequence is not important for GFP translocation (Figs. 6B and 6C: k, l). GFP fusion proteins containing either the predicted GC TM (GFP GCA) or cytoplasmic domain (GFP GCB) showed perinuclear staining, suggesting ER localization (Figs. 6B and 6C: m, n).
Subsequent analyses of expressed GFP-GN fusion proteins with subcellular fractionation approaches were performed to confirm the association of the fusion proteins with cellular membranes and to demonstrate the transition of intracellular localization from a diffuse cytoplasmic to a Golgi complex region pattern (Fig. 8). For this, membrane-associated cellular proteins were separated from soluble proteins and the different fractions analyzed via immunoblot using GFP-specific antibodies. As expected, constructs GFP GNI, GFP GNA, and GFP GNB, containing only the TM I, 87 or 99 amino acids from the predicted GN cytoplasmic domain, respectively, were only detected in the soluble fraction (Fig. 8a; only shown for GNB), whereas GFP GNC and constructs with longer parts from the GN cytoplasmic domain including the TM II region were detected mainly in the pellet fraction containing membrane-associated proteins (Fig. 8b). Constructs with longer fragments of the GN cytoplasmic domain, including additional TM regions, were exclusively detected within the pellet fraction (e.g., GFP GNG; Fig. 8c). These results confirmed our previous findings that the addition of GN TM II results in a change of intracellular protein localization and seems to mediate targeting to Golgi membranes.
Enveloped viruses, which do not acquire their lipoprotein coat by budding through the plasma membrane bud at internal membranes, including the inner nuclear membrane (herpesviruses;[43], the ER (flaviviruses and rotaviruses; [44,45], the intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (coronaviruses and poxviruses; [46,47], and the Golgi complex (rubellaviruses, coronaviruses, and bunyaviruses; [4,46,48]. Usually, the accumulation of the viral surface proteins in the specific intracellular compartment determines the assembly and budding site of the virus. This intracellular accumulation is dependent on certain compartment-specific retention or retrieval signals.
For almost all bunyaviruses assembly and budding takes place in the Golgi region [4,46,48]. However, so far no common motifs could be identified for signals within bunyaviral glycoproteins resulting in Golgi targeting and accumulation. Indeed, even the locations of such signals within bunyaviral glycoproteins are different. For the phlebovirus Uukuniemi (UUK), a Golgi retention signal could be identified within the membrane-proximal half (aa1040) of the 81 aa long cytoplasmic domain of GN [30,31,38]. In contrast, for the phlebovirus Punto Toro, such signals were mapped to the transmembrane domain (TM) and the adjacent amino acids of the GN cytoplasmic domain [36,37]. A similar localization was recently described for the Golgi retention signal in the GN of the phlebovirus Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus GN [34]. Notable, for the Old World hantavirus Hantaan (HTN) it was reported that the conformation of the GN/GC complex might play a more important role for Golgi accumulation than an actual primary sequence motif [39].
While extensive studies have been performed regarding intracellular budding sites and glycoprotein accumulation for members of the genera Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Hantavirus and Tospovirus [30,32,34-36,39,40], nothing is known for members of the genus Nairovirus. Here we demonstrated, for the first time, that the CCHFV GN protein is membrane associated and contains a Golgi localization motif. In addition we have mapped this signal to a hydrophobic region (TM II) within the predicted cytoplasmic tail [5]. Co-expressed GN and GC result in a specific Golgi accumulation and co-localization using specific Golgi markers, whereas individual expressed GC is retained in the ER. These results imply that the two CCHFV glycoproteins have to interact and form hetero-oligomers for a proper Golgi transport of GC.
GFP-fusion proteins containing different portions of the CCHF GN glycoprotein allowed mapping of the Golgi targeting sequence within the cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, we located the signal downstream of the predicted protease cleavage site RKLL at position 808 of the CCHFV precursor GPC, responsible for generating the C-terminus of the mature GN protein [5,28], implying that this cleavage site might not be used during the maturation process of GN. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that the addition of only the hydrophobic region from the predicted TM II within the GN cytoplasmic domain targeted a GFP-fusion protein to the Golgi complex. This shows that the 23 amino acids of TM II are sufficient and necessary for targeting GFP to the Golgi region, whereas the first 99 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain and the TM I domain do not contribute to Golgi targeting.
The results obtained from the GFP-GN fusion proteins seem contradictory to the studies with the GN expression plasmid. IFA data combined with confocal microscopy co-localization studies of cells transfected with GNs expression plasmids demonstrated a clear Golgi complex staining (Fig. 3A: b, g; Fig. 4e). Since GNs contains only the first 87 amino acids of the predicted cytoplasmic domain without the predicted TM II sequence, we expected that the corresponding GFP-fusion protein GFP-GNA would show similar intracellular localization. However, the diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm of transfected cells demonstrates that the first 87 amino acids are not sufficient to target the GFP to the Golgi complex (GFP-GNA; Figs. 6B and 6C: c). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the existence of a second Golgi localization signal located within the GN ectodomain. Such a signal would be the reason for the Golgi localization pattern of GNs, whereas GFP-GNC and fusion proteins containing longer fragments of the predicted GN cytoplasmic domain localize to the Golgi region because of a Golgi localization signal located in TM II.
CCHFV GC protein expressed by its own retained in the ER and did not relocate into the Golgi complex. Interestingly, similar to all described GC proteins of phleboviruses CCHFV GC proteins also contain a lysine-based ER retrieval signal (KKXX; [49] within the predicted cytoplasmic domain. In case of single expressed GC protein this signal is most likely responsible for the ER localization of the protein, even though GFP-CCHF GCA fusion proteins containing only the predicted TM showed perinuclear staining pattern (Figs. 6B and 6C: m). However, co-expression with GN protein leads to interaction between these two proteins most likely resulting in masking of the ER retrieval signal and an accumulation of the heterodimer in the Golgi complex, due to the Golgi retention signal(s) located on GN (Fig. 3A: d, e, i, j; Fig. 4g). A similar phenomenon with conflicting transport/targeting signals was previously described for the rubellavirus E1 and E2 proteins [48,50,51].
In conclusion, we were able to express CCHF GN and GC glycoproteins individually as well as from the precursor GPC. GN could be localized to the Golgi compartment, whereas GC was found in the ER. Co-expression of both proteins resulted in Golgi rescue of GC, indicating that proper interaction between GN and GC is important for transportation of the heterodimer out of the ER. The potential Golgi targeting signal could be localized to a hydrophobic region within the cytoplasmic domain in the GN protein. Furthermore, our results suggest that additional signals could be localized within the GN ectodomain.
Further characterization of the CCHFV GN Golgi retention signals could provide helpful information to understand the proteolytic cleavage event(s) of the GPC and the glycoprotein maturation process. The different CCHFV G expression plasmids might show also useful for the generation of virus-like particles (VLPs) as well as for identification of interaction sites between the viral glycoproteins and the ribonucleoproteins.
The identification of the potential budding site(s) of nairoviruses and the detailed analysis of the Golgi localization signal of the CCHFV GN protein will allow subsequent studies for targeting the glycoprotein accumulation during the development of antiviral strategies or even for rational vaccine design.
BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney), 293T (human embryonic kidney), VeroE6 (African green monkey kidney) and SW13 cells (human adenocarcinoma cells)(American Type Culture Collection) were grown on plastic dishes in Glasgow (BHK-21), Eagle's minimal essential (293T, VeroE6), or Leibovitz L15 (SW13) medium, respectively, supplemented with 5 to 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Invitrogen). The CCHFV, strain IbAr10200, isolated in 1970 from ticks (Hyalomma excavatum) in Nigeria (Sokoto), kindly provided by Special Pathogens Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta (T. G. Ksiazek), was used for all experiments. The CCHFV stocks were prepared on SW13 cells by infection of T162 cell culture flasks with a 1:100 dilution. Supernatant was collected three days post infection (p.i.), clarified from cell debris by low speed centrifugation (3,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C), and aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen. Virus titers were determined either by plaque assay or 50% tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50).
Total RNA was isolated 7 days post infection from VeroE6 cells infected with CCHFV (1:1000 dilution of virus stock; 10-3 pfu, RNA sample #1). Additional CCHFV RNA was kindly provided by J. Smith, USAMRIID, Alphavax, Durham, N.C. (RNA sample #2). CCHFV specific M segment vRNA or cRNA molecules were reverse transcribed using the primers CCHF M1 (TCTCAAAGAAATAGTGGCGGCACGCAGTC) or CCHF M2 (TCTCAAAGAAATACTTGCGGCACGTCAGT) for the reverse transcription reaction, respectively. The resulting cDNA molecules were used as templates for subsequent PCR reactions producing overlapping PCR fragments covering the entire CCHFV M segment. PCR products were inserted into pCR4 using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Prior to sequence determination, positive clones were screened by PCR technology (primer TOPO F: AGCTCGGATCCACTAGTAACG and TOPO R: ATGCTCGAGCGGCCGCCAGTG) and restriction enzyme digest (EcoRI). For vRNA and cRNA-based constructs three of the cloning plasmids were sequenced using primers specific for the M segment ORF. The sequence results were aligned to the genebank sequence U39455 using the Align Plus 5 program of the Clone Manager Professional Suite 6 (Scientific & Educational Software). Determined nucleotide exchanges and the corresponding amino acid differences are listed in Table 1. For sequence determination of the M segment ends CCHFV specific vRNA and cRNA molecules were ligated using T4 RNA ligase (Roche) prior to the reverse transcription reaction (vRNA: M32: AGAACCAGAGGCCTGTTCAA, cRNA: M33: AAGGTGTCTGTGCCGGTTGT). Subsequent PCR amplification with primers CCHF M34 (AATACTAGTCTAAT CCACTGGCTGGTGTT) and M35 (AATGAATTCTGCCGAACTGTTCTCTAC) generated fragments containing both segment ends. PCR products were inserted into pCR4 (Invitrogen) for direct sequence determination as described above. In total, 12 cRNA/mRNA and 37 vRNA clones were analyzed using T7 and T3 promoter-specific primers.
Based on the recently published N-terminal sequence determination of mature CCHFV glycoproteins [5], expression plasmids for both glycoproteins were generated. In case of the CCHFV GN two constructs were generated since the C terminus of the mature GN is not yet experimentally determined: pCMV CCHF GN "short" (GNs) contains the GN-ORF from pos. 519 to 807, preceding the predicted C-terminal cleavage site RKLL at position 808 (44). pCMV CCHF GN "long" (GNl) consists of pos. 519 to 1040 extending the GN-ORF to the experimentally determined N-terminal end of GC. The PCR fragments (GNs: RF346/352, GNl: RF353/352) were inserted after BsmBI endonuclease treatment into pDisplay (Invitrogen) previously digested with BglII/XmaI digest, resulting in CMV-driven (human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter and enhancer) expression plasmids for CCHFV GN. The Ig κ-chain signal peptide sequence and the hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope of the pDisplay vector were used for correct intracellular processing and detection, respectively. The CCHFV GC was PCR-amplified using primers CCHF M9 (AGTTGGTCTAGCCAATGTGTG) and RF351 (AATCGTCTCAAATTCATGGAGAC AGACACACTCCTGCTATGGGTACTGCTGCTCTGGGTTCCAGGTTCCACTGGTGACTTCCTAGATAGTACAGCTAAAGGCATG) (pos. 1041 to 1684).
BsmBI- and XhoI-restricted PCR fragments were inserted into the plasmid pCAGGS/MCS [52] prior digested with EcoRI/XhoI digest, resulting in a chicken β-actin-driven expression plasmid for CCHFV GC. For correct intracellular processing of the CCHFV GC we inserted the Ig κ-chain signal peptide of the pDisplay vector via forward oligonucleotide primer RF351.
Different expression strategies (CMV-, chicken β-actin-driven) were used for the different CCHFV glycoproteins to yield maximum expression levels.
CCHFV glycoprotein expression plasmid DNA was transfected into subconfluent BHK-21 or 293T cells (3 × 106) using 2 to 4 μg of the respective plasmid and 8 μl of liposome plus buffer (LipofectAMINE PLUS; Life Technologies, Invitrogen) mixed in serum-free MEM and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After addition of 12 μl of liposome reagent, incubation was continued for a further 15 min. The cells were incubated at 37°C with the DNA-Lipofectamine mixture for 3 h. To determine the efficiency of transfection, plasmid pHL2823, expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP) under the CMV immediate early promoter and enhancer (R. Flick and G. Hobom, unpublished), was transfected similarly. After further incubation for 20–24 h in MEM containing 2% FCS, the transfected cells were fixed and CCHFV glycoprotein expression levels determined using indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA).
293T or BHK-21 cells grown on coverslips within a 6-well dish were transfected as described above. After 20 to 44 h, cycloheximide (final concentration of 0.18 mM) was added when indicated to inhibit further protein synthesis. The cells were incubated for an additional 2 to 5 h and then washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.5) and fixed in methanol:acetone (50:50, V/V) for 20 min at -20°C. Permeabilization was omitted by fixation with paraformaldehyde when surface-expressed proteins were to be detected. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS and blocked for at least 30 min with PBS containing 5 % bovine serum albumin (BSA). Poly- or monoclonal antisera were diluted in PBS containing 1 % BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes with PBS, goat anti-rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or tetramethyl rhodamin isothiocyanate (TRITC) were incubated with the cells for 45 to 60 min at room temperature. Procedures were repeated for double labeling with a different antiserum and fluorescent probe, and at the end of the procedure the slides were washed with PBS overnight.
Intracellular localization of the glycoproteins GN was determined by co-localization with commercially available organelle-specific fluorescent dyes (Molecular Probe Inc., Oregon, USA): BODIPY-TR C5 ceramide was selected as an indicator of the Golgi region. In addition Golgi (mannosidase II; Sigma) and ER-specific (Calreticulin; Sigma) monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies were used.
Sample preparation and immunocytochemical staining were the same as for wide-field fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence staining patterns were analysed with a ZEISS LSM 510 UV META laser scanning confocal microscope (Jena, Germany) equipped with a Coherent Enterprise II 81 mW Argon UV laser, a Lasos 30 mW Argon laser, and 5 mW HeNe laser. Images were acquired with a C-apochromat 63/1.2 corr. water-immersion lens. FITC-stained proteins were imaged with excitation at 488 nm and with a 505 to 530 nm bandpass emission filter. Golgi marker BODIPY-TR C5 ceramide were imaged with excitation at 543 nm and with a 570 to 655 nm bandpass emission. DAPI-stained DNA was imaged with excitation at 364 nm and emission through a 385 to 470 bandpass filter. Merged pictures for analysis of intracellular co-localization were generated using Zeiss LSM Image Brower 3.2 software.
Alkaline carbonate extraction was performed on BHK-21 cells 24–48 h post transfection. The protocol described in Current Protocols in Cell Biology Online, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. was followed. Briefly, BHK-21 cells were transfected with individual constructs as described before. At 24 to 48 h post transfection, supernatant was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS followed by an additional washing step with 100 ml NaCl. Occasionally, the transfected cells would detach from the plate thus, the non-adherent cells were isolated between washes by microcentrifugation (2 min at 1000 × g). Remaining cells were scraped (adherent) or resuspended (non-adherent) into 1 ml of ice-cold 100 mM sodium carbonate, pH 11.5 and homogenized (five strokes) in a 2 ml Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was then incubated for 30 min on ice and 1 ml of sodium carbonate was added to attain the necessary volume for subsequent ultracentrifugation (2 ml). The homogenate was then centrifuged for 60 min at 50.000 rpm using a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman) at 4°C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and concentrated three to five times. The pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of sodium carbonate. Pellet and supernatant fractions were then mixed with 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and run on SDS-PAGE. Protein gels were then transferred to PVDF transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a Trans-blot SD semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins were subsequently visualized by immunoblot.
Following transfer, the blot was blocked overnight in 5 % skim milk + 0.1 % Tween. The following morning, the blot was washed three times with PBS/0.1 % Tween then incubated with the primary antibody, e.g. anti-GFP (Oncogene) at a 1:2000 dilution in PBS for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. The blot was then washed three times with PBS/0.1 % Tween and incubated with the secondary antibody, goat anti rabbit HRP (Sigma) at a 1:30.000 dilution in PBS for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. The blot was then washed with PBS/0.1 %Tween three times, followed by three washes with PBS. Proteins were visualized using the ECL+plus Western Blotting Detection system (Amersham Biosciences).

20. A Three-Stemmed mRNA Pseudoknot in the SARS Coronavirus Frameshift Signal
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, late in 2002. Its rapid transmission and high rates of mortality and morbidity resulted in a significant threat to global health by the spring of 2003, and the epidemic had a significant effect on the public health and economies of locales affected by SARS outbreaks. The rapid response of the World Health Organization is credited with containing this contagion by late June 2003, and only a few cases were reported during the winter cold season of 2003–2004. The severity of this crisis mobilized the scientific community as well: by March 24, 2003, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in Hong Kong had announced that a new coronavirus had been isolated from patients with SARS (reviewed in [1]). The sequences from two isolates of SARS-CoV were published simultaneously on May 1, 2003 [2,3].
Coronaviruses are enveloped animal viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases. Analysis of the SARS-CoV genome revealed that, similar to all coronaviruses, the 70% (approximately) at the 5′ end of its large single (+) stranded RNA genome consists of two sizable genes called ORF1a and ORF1b. The 3′ ORF1b overlaps, and is out of frame with, its 5′ neighbor, ORF1a, and similar to other coronaviruses, a programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift (−1 PRF) was posited to be used by the virus to produce an ORF1a/1b fusion protein [2]. A wide range of RNA viruses use −1 PRF for the production of viral fusion protein (reviewed in [4–6]). In many such cases, e.g., the Retroviridae and Totiviridae, the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting determines the stoichiometric ratio between structural and enzymatic proteins available for viral particle assembly, and even small changes in frameshift frequencies can have profound negative effects on virus propagation, thus targeting −1 PRF for antiviral therapies (reviewed in [7]). It has been shown that the SARS-Cov −1 PRF signal is able to promote efficient frameshifting in a rabbit reticulcyte system, and the −1 PRF signal reported in that publication consisted of a typical heptameric “slippery site” (UUU
AAAC), a 5-nt spacer, and a typical H-form mRNA pseudoknot containing two double-stranded RNA stems and two single-stranded loops [8]. Two very recently published papers have suggested that the SARS-CoV mRNA pseudoknot may contain a third stem-loop structure [9, 10]. In this work, we present computational, comparative genomic, molecular, biophysical, and genetic evidence demonstrating that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal includes a new type of highly ordered three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot that likely contains a large number of noncanonical base interactions. Although total deletion of the third stem does not significantly alter frameshifting efficiency, its disruption significantly inhibits this process. The fact that this general structure appears to be conserved among the coronaviruses raises questions regarding its biological function.

−1 PRF signals typically have a tripartite organization. From 5′ to 3′, these are composed of a heptameric “slippery site,” a “spacer” region, and a stable mRNA secondary structure, typically an mRNA pseudoknot (reviewed in [11]). A previous analysis of the SARS-CoV −1 PRF signal demonstrated that a sequence spanning nucleotide positions 13392–13472 satisfied these three requirements and was able to promote efficient −1 PRF in rabbit reticulocyte lysates [8]. The −1 PRF signal presented in that study contained a typical mRNA pseudoknot composed of two double-helical, Watson–Crick basepaired stems connected by two single-stranded loops (Figure 1A).
The presence of a long, 29-nt loop 2 seemed to be unusual, prompting us to subject the sequence from positions 13392–13472 to additional computational analyses in an effort to further define the structure of this mRNA pseudoknot. The nucleotide sequence suspected of featuring a −1 PRF signal between ORF1a and ORF1b was scanned by RNAMotif [12], using a pattern-based description capable of finding common −1 PRF signals in other RNA viruses. As expected, a so-called slippery site (UUU
AAAC) and a large H-type pseudoknot were identified—the two primary stimulating elements required for efficient ribosomal slippage. This analysis was coupled with Pknots [13], a software package that predicts the most thermodynamically stable structure for a given RNA sequence. The predicted structure for the SARS-CoV frameshift signal was extremely stable, with a calculated minimum free energy (MFE) of −26.68 kcal/mol. The surprising result was that the 29-nt sequence designated loop 2 by Thiel et al. [8] was predicted to form a third helix, nested within the sequences defined by stems 1 and 2 (Figure 1B). Though a small, internally nested third helix (helix-3) has been shown to be present in the HIV-1 group O frameshift signal [14], such an extensive basepairing pattern has not to our knowledge been heretofore demonstrated for any other viral frameshift signal. To determine the statistical significance of this finding, a distribution of MFE values taken from 500 randomly shuffled SARS-CoV frameshift signals was created. Each of the randomly shuffled sequences was folded using Pknots with the same parameters. The resulting normal distribution had mean MFE of −21.12 kcal/mol (standard deviation = 2.67, 500×), revealing that the predicted three-stemmed pseudoknot structure of the native sequence is highly significant with a z-score of −2.05 and a p value of 0.02 (one-tailed Student's t-test).

To address the question of whether the potential to form a three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is unique to the SARS-CoV, we searched for such structures in all of the known viral −1 PRF signals listed in the RECODE 2003 database [15], as well as the putative frameshift signals in all of the sequenced members of the Order Nidovirales (including coronaviruses and arteriviruses). The SARS-CoV frameshift signal itself is homologous to all of the nine other frameshift signals for coronaviruses whose genomes have been fully sequenced. A multiple sequence alignment of the ten coronavirus frameshift signals is presented in Figure 2. This shows that both stems 1 and 2 are highly conserved, with a strong conservation of base complementation in the cores of both stems 1 and 2 (blue and red sequences, respectively). This analysis also shows all of the coronavirus frameshift signals have the potential to form a third helix, although the structures and sequences are less well conserved (Figure 2, in green). In addition, the potential of sequences located approximately 200 nt downstream of the slippery site to form long-range “kissing loop” interactions with the 5′ half of stem 2 was previously noted for HCoV-229E [16] and TEGV [17]. This property was only conserved among all of the group 2 coronaviruses, not in any of the others (see Figure 2). The potential significance of this observation is discussed below. A phylogenetic tree of the −1 PRF signals constructed from the multiple sequence alignment is presented in Figure 3. As expected, the group 1 and group 2 coronaviruses cluster together, and neither the SARS-CoV nor the avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) frameshift signals cluster with either group. Of particular interest, however, is that very similar mRNA pseudoknot structures are predicted to occur within groups—but not between them.
In light of the computational findings, we conducted biochemical analyses of the SARS-CoV frameshift signal using a [32P] 5′ end labeled SP6 RNA polymerase product spanning nucleotides 13399–13475. RNase A cleaves preferentially at single-stranded pyrimidine bases, RNase T1 cuts at single-stranded guanosine residues, and RNase V1 cleaves double-stranded RNA. We also examined alkaline hydrolysis cleavage patterns at low concentrations of sodium hydroxide to identify exposed phosphodiester bonds. Representative autoradiograms of the reactions are shown in Figure 4A and 4B, and the predicted cleavage patterns mapped onto the pseudoknot structure are shown in Figure 4C.
The nuclease mapping data are generally consistent with the computational predictions, showing double-stranded regions corresponding to all three stems. Some notable deviations from the predicted structure were observed, however. These fell into three general classes. One class consisted of distortions in predicted helical A-RNA structures, typified by bases that were equally digested by both single- and double-strand-specific nucleases and by nearby bases that were refractory to nuclease attack. These clustered in the middle of stem 1 (13406–13410 and 13427), near the middle of stem 2 (13419–13420), and in the middle of stem 3 (13436–13439 and 13458–13461). Another major group consisted of bases located in regions predicted to link the three stems that were completely protected from nuclease attack. Specifically, these were G13405 and G13435 at the stem 1/stem 3 junction, G13414 and G13423–C13425 at the stem 1/stem 2 junction, and C13463 and U13464, which link stem 2 with stem 3. We also observed enhanced susceptibility of the three pyrimidines in the predicted loop 2 region (C13447, U13448, and U13451) to attack by both single- and double-strand-specific endonucleases, suggesting that this region is structurally dynamic under the conditions assayed. The ability of the bulged adenosine residue at position 13467 to be recognized by RNaseV1 demonstrates that it is involved in a basepairing interaction, whereas the opposite pertains with regard to A13446, A13452, and A13456. The three bases at the 5′ and 3′ terminal ends of the molecule could not be meaningfully resolved.
Given the ambiguity of the nuclease mapping, homo- and heteronuclear two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were used to confirm the predicted basepairing interactions of the three stems. The presence of 21 hydrogen-bonded guanine and uracil residues for the sequence including residues 13405–13472 of the SARS-CoV genome (Figure 5A) was evident from the imino region observed in the 2D 1H,1H-NOESY, 15N-HMQC, and quantitative J(N,N) HNN-COSY data. In this study, we have obtained sequential imino 1H and 15N assignments for the A-form helices of the frameshifting SARS pseudoknot, using a combination of information from 1H,1H-NOE and 1H,15N-HMQC spectra. The latter experiment distinguishes between uridine and guanosine iminos by the characteristic 15N chemical shift, whereas the NOESY yields sequential 1H,1H-NOEs connecting imino protons in helical stem regions.
Assignments were made for 8 bp in stem 1, 4 bp in stem 2, and 5 bp in stem 3 (Figure 5). As a result of fraying, the terminal basepairs of helical stem regions are not observed. Of those basepairs assigned, 16 are Watson–Crick-type basepairs and only one is a canonical wobble G:U basepair. This G:U basepair present in stem 3 can be inferred directly from the strong NOE correlation between the G38 and U59 imino protons (Figure 5C). The corresponding donor G38:N1 and U59:N3 imino nitrogens are evidently not engaged in G:C or U:A hydrogen bonds (Figure 5D).
The quantitative J(N,N) HNN-COSY contains a total of five correlations between the imino N3 nitrogens of uridines and the N1 nitrogens in adenines, indicative of canonical Watson–Crick-type basepairing interaction. A total of 11 correlations stemming from Watson–Crick G:C basepairs are observed between the imino N1 nitrogens of guanosines and the N3 nitrogens of cytidines. In summary, the complete sequential NOE walk connecting most of the basepaired imino protons unambiguously confirmed the presence of three stems corresponding to the secondary structure prediction shown (Figure 5A).
To address the question of whether the predicted SARS-CoV −1 PRF signal functions similarly to −1 PRF promoting elements from other viruses, this sequence was cloned into bicistronic dual luciferase reporter constructs designed to assay programmed ribosomal frameshifting using in vitro and in vivo systems [18,19]. As a minor modification, instead of using a simple readthrough construct as the zero-frame control, the corresponding control contained the SARS-CoV −1 PRF signal with one additional base inserted 3′ of the Renilla luciferase sequence and 5′ of the −1 PRF signal. The resulting zero-frame reporter places the firefly luciferase ORF in frame with Renilla and inactivates the −1 PRF signal by moving it out of frame with regard to elongating ribosomes, while controlling for ribosomes dislodged from the reporter mRNAs by the mRNA pseudoknot. This seemed to alleviate the large errors observed by other groups using similar methodology (e.g., [9]).
The ability of the SARS-CoV sequence to promote −1 PRF was assessed using two different in vitro and in vivo assay systems each. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 6A. In vitro, the SARS-CoV sequence was able to promote efficient −1 PRF in both wheat germ protoplasts (23.7% ± 1.9%) and rabbit reticulocytes (14.3% ± 3.7%). In vivo, the sequence was able to promote efficient −1 PRF in the Vero epithelial cell line (14.4% ± 0.6%), a finding that is important in light of the fact that the SARS-CoV infects lung epithelial cells. The sequence also promoted efficient −1 PRF in yeast cells, suggesting that this frameshift signal might be amenable to the molecular genetic toolbox available in the yeast system. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of a drug (anisomycin) and of a host cell mutant (mak8–1) that were previously shown to specifically affect L-A virus–directed −1 PRF in yeast cells [20–22]. The results of these experiments show that, similar to their effects on L-A-promoted −1 PRF, anisomycin was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-directed −1 PRF (21% inhibition, p = 5.04 × 10−8), whereas −1 PRF was stimulated in cells harboring the mak8–1 allele of RPL3 (25% stimulation, p = 5.0 × 10−5) (Figure 6B). These findings show that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal is amenable to analysis by the full array of yeast-based genetic, pharmacological, and molecular tools that we and others have developed. Interestingly, the absolute values for frameshifting in yeast (2.99% ± 0.06%) were significantly less than those observed in the other systems (ranging from approximately 15% to 25%), suggestive of differences between fungal and metazoan ribosomes that might be pharmacologically exploited. This is discussed in greater detail below.
Given that Vero cells more resemble the natural host of SARS-CoV than do yeast, a series of mutants of the SARS-CoV frameshift signal were developed to functionally dissect the mRNA pseudoknot in this cell type. Typically, mutagenesis experiments are constructed so as to change one or another side of a stem to disrupt basepairing, and then to combine the two mutants to re-form the stem (e.g., see [23,24]). The series of mutants that were created by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to address this question is shown in Figure 7. The S2 series of mutants were designed to examine the general requirement for stem 2, and the specific contribution of the bulged adenosine residue at position 13467 was designed to stimulate efficient −1 PRF. Similarly, the S3 mutant series were designed to examine the general requirement for stem 3, as well as the specific contribution of the bulged adenosine at position 13456. The complete data for these experiments, as formatted according to [25], are presented in Dataset S1.
Six different stem 2 mutants were assayed for their ability to promote efficient −1 PRF (Figure 7). Not surprisingly, disruption of stem 2 (S2A and S2A′) precluded efficient −1 PRF. Unexpectedly, however, compensatory mutations that should promote re-formation of the basic stem 2 structure (S2B′) did not restore wild-type levels of frameshifting, suggesting the involvement of a primary mRNA sequence in this region in stimulating −1 PRF. However, the adenosine base at position 13465 in this construct had to be replaced with a guanosine to avoid creating a −1 frame termination codon. Though this substitution retains the potential to basepair with U13424, it is possible that the identity of the base at this position is critical. To examine this parameter, the base at this position was changed to guanosine in the context of an otherwise wild-type −1 PRF signal (A13465G). Though this mutation did not abrogate efficient −1 PRF, frameshifting efficiency was decreased by approximately 38% (p = 1.7 × 10−6). This result suggests that though this mutation was not the main cause of the dramatic reduction in −1 PRF observed with S2B′, the identity of the base at this position is important for maximizing −1 PRF efficiency. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that both the general structure and base-specific sequence of stem 2 are required for efficient −1 PRF.
Bulged adenosine residues are known to stimulate assembly of higher-order RNA structures by helping to link helices together [26]. Two constructs were assayed to examine the requirement of the bulged residue at position 13467 for efficient −1 PRF. In mutant S2C′, A13467 was substituted with cytosine, whereas in construct S2C, the adenosine at position 13467 was removed from the middle of stem 2 and repositioned six bases downstream to maintain translational reading frame. Either replacing the A-bulge with cytosine (S2C′) or deleting it entirely (S2C) dramatically reduced frameshifting in Vero cells (>94%, p < 3.3 × 10−16), repressing −1 PRF to a similar extent as the mutants S2A, S2A′, and S2B′.
Similar to the approach described above, five mutants were constructed to investigate stem 3 (Figure 7). Constructs S3A, S3A′, S3B, and S3C′ were directed toward addressing the function of stem 3: in S3A, the guanine and cytosine residues in the 5′ half of stem 3 were mutated to cytosine and guanine, respectively, disrupting stem 3; the opposing mutations were made in the 5′ half of stem 3 in S3A′; and S3B harbored the compensatory mutations to allow re-formation of stem 3. Frameshifting with S3A was reduced by 68% (p = 2.61 × 10−24), and −1 PRF was significantly, although less dramatically, reduced in S3A′ (36% of wild-type, p < 1.07 × 10−19). Similar to the effects observed in stem 2, the presence of compensatory mutations in construct S3B did not rescue −1 PRF efficiency to near wild-type levels, again suggesting that both the general structure of stem 3 and specific sequences within it are required for maximal stimulation of −1 PRF.
Similar to stem 2, a bulged adenosine is predicted in stem 3 at position 13456, and the phylogenetic analysis showed that this base was conserved among all of the coronaviruses. Substitution of this base to cytosine (S3C′) promoted a moderate but significant reduction in −1 PRF (26% inhibition, p = 2.56 × 10−11). In addition, as no significant internal nested stems have been observed in other viral frameshift pseudoknots, and because deletion of sequence corresponding to this region did not dramatically affect −1 PRF in AIBV [27], the entire stem 3–forming region was deleted in construct ΔS3 to create a more typical two-stemmed H-type RNA pseudoknot. In Vero cells, this smaller pseudoknot, lacking the third nested helix, actually promoted a modest increase in frameshifting (9.2%, p = 2.15 × 10−3), demonstrating that stem 3 is not critical for promoting efficient −1 PRF per se.
An analogous series of constructs were also assayed in yeast (data not shown). In general, the trends were similar, though the actual baseline frameshifting efficiencies were lower. For example, in mutants S2A, S2A′, and S2B′, frameshifting was equally reduced by 85%–90%; the S3A and S3A′ mutations also resulted in moderate (35%–89%) decreases in yeast, and deletion of stem 3 (ΔS3) also presented a slight increase in −1 PRF (35%) in yeast cells. There were some notable contrasts, however: though the S2C′ and S2C constructs dramatically reduced frameshifting in Vero cells (95%), they only reduced −1 PRF by approximately 25%–33% in yeast. More strikingly, some of the mutations that resulted in a 25%–30% decrease in −1 PRF in Vero cells (A13465G, S3B, and S3C′) did not affect the overall rate of −1 PRF in yeast at all. The potential significance of these findings is discussed below.
Though the first descriptions of the mRNA secondary structure stimulating −1 PRF [28] and of an RNA pseudoknot [29] were serendipitously published back to back in 1985, the two concepts were only functionally linked together 1 y later in studies of a coronavirus, AIBV [30]. Here, the coronaviruses have again revealed a new twist on mRNA pseudoknots and −1 PRF. The phylogenetic comparisons presented in this study reveal that stem 1 lengths and G:C compositions are highly conserved in all ten coronavirus sequences analyzed. Their relatively long G:C-rich composition presumably contributes significantly to the stability of these structures. In contrast, stem 2 structures are predicted to vary significantly between the different coronavirus groups. Specifically, the group 2 coronaviruses (HCoV-043C, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV, and MHV) have the longest and most stable predicted stem 2 structures, whereas the stem 2 regions of the group 1 coronaviruses (TGV, PDEV, HCoV-NL, and HCoV-229E) are anticipated to be the least stable. The stem 2 regions of SARS-CoV and AIBV appear to be intermediate between these two. Although the sequences in the stem 3/loop 3 region are not well conserved, a third stem independently predicted in the SARS-CoV −1 PRF signal [10] has been demonstrated in this work, and we predict third stems in other coronavirus frameshift signals. Similar structures are generally predicted to be able to form within groups.
Specifically, loop 3 is predicted to be long and positioned between stems 3 and 2 in the group 2 coronaviruses. In contrast, the group 1 viruses contain little or no loop 3 but, rather, have an extended loop 2 positioned between stems 1 and 3. The notable exception is TGV, in which the relative structure and orientation of stem 3 and loop 3 more resembles those observed in SARS-CoV and AIBV.
Structurally, the nuclease analyses, showing distortions of the regular helical structures in the stems, protection of specific bases from nuclease attack, and the apparent involvement of bases in loop 3 and of A13467 in basepairing interactions, suggest that the three stems fold back on one another to form a complex, globular RNA structure. Long-range interaction anchors mediated by adenosine residues such as those at positions 13456 (stem 3) and 13467 (stem 2), making contact with the shallow minor grooves of two stacked basepairs of A-form helical stems, are a recurring theme in RNA structural biology. For example, the crystal structure of the ribosome reveals that RNA has a remarkable propensity for contributing adenine bases to such A-minor interactions [31], thereby stimulating the assembly of higher-order RNA structures [26]. Mounting evidence suggests that stimulation of −1 PRF by mRNA pseudoknots requires specific noncanonical basepairing between helical stems and pseudoknot loop regions to set specifically required frameshift efficiencies. The structures of the few frameshift-promoting pseudoknots that have been determined at the atomic level are revealing that a large range of higher-order noncovalent interactions serve to promote stable, novel structures [32–36]. It is clear that the three-helix-containing mRNA pseudoknot described here represents a novel global architecture stimulating ribosomal frameshifting, and possibly a source of new structural motifs in the coming future. Experiments are currently underway to define this structure at the atomic level, using high-resolution NMR techniques. Elucidation of this novel mRNA structure will be of great utility in the rational development of therapeutic agents designed to interfere with SARS-CoV programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting, and in furthering our understanding of how different pseudoknots stimulate translational recoding.
Molecular genetic analysis of stem 2 of the SARS-CoV pseudoknot, demonstrating that frameshifting was reduced in all cases, including our attempts to make complementary mutations, indicates that primary sequences as well as structures are important for maximal frameshifting. Possible reasons for the observed sequence specificity could include aberrant folding or disruption of an essential interaction required for formation of the complex tertiary mRNA structure. For example, the findings that changing the identities of the bulged adenosine residues in stems 2 and 3 from adenosine to cytosine (S2C′ and S3C′), or deleting the bulge in stem 2 altogether (S2C), abrogated the stimulatory effects of the pseudoknot support the notion that this structural property of bulged adenosine residues is functionally important in this context. In addition, water-nucleobase “stacking” in the form of H-π and lone pair-π interactions have been demonstrated at the junctions between the stems in the BWYV pseudoknot [34]. The corresponding regions of the wild-type SARS-CoV pseudoknot were refractory to nuclease attack and were disrupted in S2A, S2A′, S2B′, S3, S3A′, and S3B, possibly explaining the effects of all of these mutants on frameshifting. The changes made in S2C and S2C′ are also adjacent to this region, and inhibition of frameshifting is nearly as dramatic as with the S2A, S2A′, and S2B′ mutants.
Though alterations to stem 3 significantly reduced frameshifting levels, these effects were one to two orders of magnitude less than analogous mutations of stem 2. This is supported by the observation in another study that alteration of the sequence in stem 3 also promoted decreases in −1 PRF [9]. Further, complete deletion of stem 3 had only a minimal effect on frameshifting efficiency—an observation consistent with studies in AIBV, in which deletion of all but 5 nt between stems 1 and 2 did not significantly alter −1 PRF [27,37]. These findings demonstrate that the presence of stem 3 is not required for efficient frameshifting per se. However, its high degree of conservation among the coronaviruses and its location in the frameshift signal suggest that it plays a more complex role in programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting as it relates to the viral life-cycle. A similar conclusion was drawn by the authors of another independent study that was performed concurrently with ours and that was published while this manuscript was under review [9].
If stem 3 is not required to promote efficient frameshifting, why then has it been so highly conserved among the coronaviruses? It may be that frameshifting levels in coronaviruses need to be regulated in a manner not supported by a two-stem pseudoknot. For example, the frameshift signal marks the boundary between proteins required during the immediate early phase of infection (e.g., ORF1a-encoded proteases used to prepare the cell for virus production) and those required for intermediate functions in the viral life cycle (i.e., ORF1b-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase used in transcription of subgenomic mRNAs, [−] strand synthesis, and genome replication). One of the fundamental problems of in the biology of (+) RNA viruses regards the switch between translation and replication. An elegant model proposes that the −1 ribosomal frameshift in barley yellow dwarf virus plays a central role in remodeling the (+) strand from translation competent to replication competent: frameshifting enables synthesis of the replicase, which in turn is able to denature the frameshift-promoting cis-acting element, eventually clearing the (+) strand of ribosomes that could potentially block the replicase [23]. In coronaviruses, the idea of functional switching by RNA remodeling has been demonstrated for MHV [38], and similar functional elements are present in both SARS-CoV and BCoV [39].
In a previous study, frameshifting in HCoV-229E was shown to be stimulated by a short sequence approximately 200 nt downstream from the slippery site, and it was shown that efficient frameshifting is promoted by kissing-loop interactions [16]. A subsequent report also found this potential motif in the TGV genome [17]. The phylogenetic analysis presented here reveals the potential to form similar short imperfect stem 2 structures for the other two group 1 coronaviruses for which the sequence is known (HCoV-NL and PEDV). In contrast, similar interactions cannot be readily discerned in SARS-CoV, nor among the group 2 and group 3 coronaviruses. Nevertheless, the idea that viral sequences in the pseudoknot may interact either in cis with sequences on the (+) strand or in trans with either sequences in subgenomic mRNAs or on the (−) strand to modulate frameshifting remains an intriguing possibility.
A final finding of interest derives from the observed differences between yeast- and metazoan-derived frameshift assay systems. This represents a potentially exciting avenue of exploration, as it may be indicative of mRNA folding differences between the two systems or of differences in how yeast versus metazoan ribosomes interact with downstream mRNA structures. This could be a result of relative size differences in the ribosomes. Alternatively, the lower levels of frameshifting in yeast relative to wild-type in the Vero cells could reflect a higher sensitivity of these ribosomes to subtle changes in the frameshift signal. The normal levels of frameshifting in yeast promoted by the S3B and S3C′ mutants further support the notion that the reason for stem 3 may lie with some function other than programmed ribosomal frameshifting.
The SARS-CoV −1 PRF signal was identified from the complete genome sequence, using a combined approach. First, a pattern matching descriptor of known −1 PRF signals was used in conjunction with RNAMotif [12] to identify the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the frameshift signal's slippery site. Second, Pknots [13] was employed to “fold” the sequence immediately downstream (3′) to the slippery site and to produce a predicted MFE value in kilocalories per mole for the sequence. The statistical significance of the predicted MFE value of the three-stemmed RNA pseudoknot was tested by generating 500 randomly shuffled sequences derived from the native sequence, refolding each of these, and calculating their MFE values using Pknots. This resulted in a normal distribution of MFE values, against which the native sequence could be compared and z-scores calculated. FASTA3 v3.4 [40] was used to initially identify sequences homologous to the SARS −1 PRF signal based on primary sequence similarity. The search space included 1,724 viral genome sequences downloaded using the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Entrez Taxonomy Browser [41]. The resulting pairwise alignments produced by FASTA3 were used to produce a multiple-sequence alignment using ClustalW v1.82 [42]. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was created from this alignment and visualized using Tree View v1.6.6 [43].

Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used to amplify plasmids, and E. coli transformations were performed using the high-efficiency transformation method of Inoue et al. [44]. YPAD and a synthetic complete medium (H−) were used as described previously [45]. Yeast strain JD932 (MATa ade2–1 trp1–1 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 can1–100) and the JD1228/JD1229 isogenic pairs in which the disrupted RPL3/TCM1 allele is complemented with pRPL3 or pmak8–1 (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 trp1δ leu2= his3 RPL3::HIS3) [21] were used for in vivo measurements of −1 PRF. Yeast cells were transformed using the alkali cation method [46]. Dual luciferase assays for programmed ribosomal frameshifting in yeast were performed as previously described [19]. African green monkey Vero cells were cultured in DMEM with L-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Maine, United States) and 10% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells cultured without antibiotics were transformed with plasmid DNA, using Amaxa (Cologne, Germany) Nucleofector solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dual luciferase assays were performed the following day, using extracts from cells lysed with the Passive Lysis Buffer (Dual-Luciferase Reporter System, Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, United States). Wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysates from Ambion (Austin, Texas, United States) were used to monitor frameshifting in vitro, using synthetic mRNA transcripts (Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit), generated with T7 polymerase either from plasmids that had been digested with SspI, Proteinase K treated, phenol/chloroform and chloroform extracted, and ammonium acetate precipitated, or from PCR amplicons encompassing the dual luciferase reporter cassettes. All assays were repeated until the data were normally distributed, enabling statistical analyses both within and between experiments [25]. At least three readings derived from lysates derived from a minimum of three different transfection plates were used.
Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by IDT (Coralville, Iowa, United States). These are listed in Table 1. The SARS-sense and SARS-antisense oligonucleotides were annealed, gel purified, and ligated into BamHI- and SacI-digested p2luc [18], generating plasmid pJD435. The Renilla and firefly bicistronic elements were amplified by PCR using previously described primers [19], SpeI- and XhoI-digested, and cloned into p416ADH [47]. One additional base was introduced after the BamHI restriction site, using the Stratagene (La Jolla, California, United States) QuikChange XL kit to correct the reading frame. Sequence analysis revealed an additional point mutation in the firefly luciferase gene that was reverted by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting plasmid, pJD465, constituted the wild-type SARS-CoV −1 PRF yeast assay plasmid. A zero-frame control plasmid, pJD474, was constructed by adding one cytosine residue upstream of the BamHI restriction site of pJD465. Additional constructs with various mutations in the pseudoknot were made; the 5′ portion of stem 3 was changed from
GCGGCACAG to
CGCCGAGAC (pJD467, also known as S3A), and this was the template for mutagenesis to make the complementary mutation in the 3′ half of stem 3, CUGAUGUCGU to GUCU
ACGGCG (pJD479, S3B). The control construct with just the changes in the 3′ portion of stem 3 was made from pJD465 (pJD567, S3A′). pJD465 was also used as the template for mutagenesis to move the A13456 residue out of stem 3 and into loop 2 (pJD492, S3C) and to make the change A13456C (pJD544, S3C′), while pJD467 was used to eliminate stem 3 entirely (pJD469, ΔS3). Stem 2 was also subjected to mutagenesis: the 5′ portion of stem 2 was changed from
GCCCG to
CGGGC (pJD466, S2A), and this in turn was the template for mutagenesis to make the complementary sequence in the 3′ half of stem 2,
CAGGGC to
GACCCG (pJD480, S2B). pJD465 was used as the template to create a construct in which the bulged A13467 residue in stem 2 was eliminated by moving it 6 nt downstream (pJD491, S2C) or replaced by cytosine (pJD542, S2C′).

An additional set of plasmids was constructed from the parental plasmids described above that lacked the yeast-specific markers but contained the SV40 early promoter, T7 promoter, and SV40 late poly (A) signal. These were used for programmed ribosomal frameshifting analyses in epithelial cells, wheat germ, and rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The BamHI and EcoRI fragment from pJD465 was purified and ligated into BamHI- and EcoRI-digested p2luc [18] to generate the test plasmid pJD502. A zero-frame control plasmid (pJD464) was constructed by cloning the BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pJD465 into p2luci. Similarly, BamHI and EcoRI fragments from the yeast plasmids described above were cloned into p2luc to generate a complete plasmid set for analyses of –1 PRF in epithelial cells (pJD503/S2A, pJD538/S2A′, pJD541/S2B′, pJD504/S2C, pJD537/S2C′, pJD487/S3A, pJD536/S3A′, pJD488/S3B, pJD506/S3C, pJD539/S3C′, and pJD490/ΔS3). An additional construct (A13465G) was made to control for the change at this position from adenine to guanine that prevents the creation of a termination codon in S2B′ constructs, but is not involved in stem 2 basepairing (pJD540 for Vero cells and pJD545 as the yeast plasmid).
The SP6SARS and revSARS oligonucleotides were used to generate a PCR amplicon from which an RNA transcript was made using the Ambion MEGAscript SP6 kit. The RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase and 5′ end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled RNA was gel purified and then eluted with 0.5 M NH4Ac, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS. Nuclease treatment with RNase A (1.0–0.01 ng), RNase T1 (1.0–0.01 U), and RNase V1 (0.1–0.001 U) from Ambion was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for 15 min at room temperature. Digested RNA was electrophoresed through a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using a Storm PhosphoImager (Sunnyvale, California, United States).
A DNA construct (residues 13405–13472 of the SARS-CoV genome) was generated by PCR from pJD465 containing the wild-type SARS-CoV frameshift pseudoknot sequence. Two oligodeoxynucleotides (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) were designed with a 5′ primer, including a T7 promoter sequence. The resulting PCR product was cloned into a pUC18 plasmid. To prepare milligram quantities of the SARS-CoV frameshift pseudoknot (residues 13405–13472), 7.5- to 20-ml in vitro transcription reactions with phage T7 polymerase from a linearized plasmid template were performed [48]. Unlabeled NTPs were purchased from Sigma Pharmaceuticals (South Croydon, United Kingdom), and labeled NTPs were purified from Methylophilus methylotropus (
ATCC 53528, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, United States) bacteria grown on labeled medium with 15N-ammonium sulfate and 13C-methanol [49]. After 4–5 h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was spun down to remove traces of precipitated pyrophosphate. RNA transcripts were purified by anion-exchange FPLC with two HiTrap Q columns (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris (pH 8) at room temperature. The target RNA sample was eluted with an increasing sodium chloride gradient. Pure fractions were concentrated using a CentriPrep YM10 (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States) concentrator, passed through a NAP25 column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with NMR buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate [pH 6.5], 200 mM potassium chloride, 0.5 mM EDTA [ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt], 0.02% sodium azide, 5% deuterium oxide), and concentrated to 0.2–2 mM, using a CentriPrep YM10 concentrator (Millipore). The identity of the RNA product was verified by mass spectroscopy, as well as agarose and TBE-Urea-PAGE (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States) gels.

All NMR spectra were recorded at 5 °C, 15 °C, and 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer (Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a standard 5-mm triple axis pulsed field gradient 1H/13C/15N probehead optimized for proton detection. NMR experiments were performed on samples of 500-μl volume containing 0.2–2 mM SARS-CoV frameshift pseudoknot RNA. Data were processed using NMRPipe [50] and analyzed using NMRVIEW [51]. One-dimensional imino proton spectra were acquired using a jump-return echo sequence. The observable iminos in aqueous solution are diagnostic for hydrogen-bonded guanine and uracil bases, which are protected from exchange with the solvent. Imino resonances were assigned sequence-specificity from water flip-back, WATERGATE 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) [52] spectra (τmix = 200 ms), and a jump-return [53] 1H,15N-heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) [54]. Elucidation of basepairing and secondary structure was verified from scalar 2h

Thousands of different microorganisms affect the health and safety of the world's populations of humans, animals, and plants. Infectious microorganisms include species of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Many different medical and governmental organizations have created lists of the pathogenic microorganisms most relevant to their missions. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains an ever-changing list of notifiable diseases, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) lists agents with potential for use in bioterrorist attacks, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains a list of critical human pathogens. Unfortunately, the nomenclature for biological agents on these lists and pathogens described in the literature is imprecise. Organisms are often referred to using common names, alternative spellings, or out-dated or alternative names. Sometimes a disease rather than a particular organism is mentioned, and often there may be multiple organisms or co-infections capable of causing a particular disease. Not surprisingly, this ambiguity poses a significant hurdle to communication among the diverse communities that must deal with epidemics or bioterrorist attacks.
To facilitate comprehensive access to information on disease-causing organisms and toxins, we have developed a database known as "The Microbial Rosetta Stone" that uses a new data model and novel computational tools to manage microbiological data [1,2]. This article focuses on the information in the database for pathogens that impact global public health, emerging infectious organisms, and bioterrorist threat agents. It provides a compilation of lists, taken from the database, of important and/or regulated biological agents from a number of agencies including HHS, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO), the NIAID, and other sources. We curated these lists to include organism names that are consistent with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nomenclature and to provide sequence accession numbers for genomic sequencing projects (if available). Important synonyms or previously used names that identify the organisms are also shown. We have organized the lists according to phylogenetic structure. This paper provides graphic representations of the phylogenetic relatedness of important pathogenic organisms.
The goal of the database is to provide an informative, readily accessible, single location for basic information on a broad range of important disease causing agents. The database will help users to avoid the pitfalls of confusing nomenclature and taxonomic relationships and allow access to literature on in-depth studies. The database can be accessed at .
In the developing world, nearly 90% of infectious disease deaths are due to six diseases or disease processes: acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, tuberculosis, HIV, measles, and malaria [see Additional File 1] [3]. In both developing and developed nations, the leading cause of death by a wide margin is acute respiratory disease [3-5]. In the developing world, acute respiratory infections are attributed primarily to six bacteria: Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydophila pneumonia, and Chlamydia trachomatis [6]. These bacteria belong to four different taxonomic classes and illustrate how similar parasitic lifestyles can evolve in parallel within unrelated bacterial species (Figure 2). Major viral causes of respiratory infections include respiratory syncytial virus (Figure 5), human parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 (Figure 5), influenza viruses A and B (Figure 5), as well as some adenoviruses (Figure 4) [5,6].
The major causes of diarrhoeal disease in the developing and developed world have significant differences due to the great disparity of availability of pure food and water and the general nutritional and health status of the populations. Important causes of diarrhoeal disease in the developing world are those that tend to be epidemic, especially Vibrio cholera, Shigella dysenteriae, and Salmonella typhi [7]. These organisms are gammaproteobacteria (Figure 2) that use many different metabolic pathways to ensure their survival in a wide range of environments. In the United States there is a much lower incidence of diarrhoeal disease overall, and a relatively greater impact of direct human-to-human infectious transmission. The most important causes of diarrhoeal disease in the United States are bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter species, Clostridium difficile, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, and Shigella species (Figure 2); viruses, such as Norwalk virus (Figure 6) and rotaviruses (Figure 7); and parasites such as Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, while microsporidia are responsible for a smaller number of cases (Figure 3).
Infectious disease agents important to the public health in the U.S. are monitored by the CDC and listed in Additional File 2 [see Additional File 2]. There are no set criteria for inclusion on the notifiable disease list; rather, the list is created by the CDC in cooperation with state health departments. As diseases occur less frequently and new diseases emerge, the notifiable disease list changes. The list provides links to case definitions of each disease, including the etiological agent(s) responsible. In cases where the etiological agent was not listed or was unspecific (i.e. Brucella spp.), further research was done to determine an etiological agent and this information is in Additional File 2 [see Additional File 2].
Each year in the United States, there are approximately 76 million cases of food-borne illness, including 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths [8,9]. In an estimated 2 to 3% of these cases, chronic sequelae develop. These sequelae include renal disease, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, neural disorders, and autoimmune disease [10]. The estimated cost of food-borne illness in the United States is $23 billion annually [8]. Mishandling of food is believed to be responsible for 85% of all outbreaks of food-borne disease in developed nations, primarily due to a lack of education [8,11-13]. Food-borne pathogens [see Additional File 3] are also important because they represent one of the largest sources of emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This is due in part to the administration of sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics to food-producing animals to enhance growth. For example, certain strains of Salmonella show resistance to eight or more antibiotics [14]. Studies have shown that antibiotic resistance in Salmonella cannot be traced to antibiotic use in humans, suggesting that antibiotic use in animals is the primary cause of resistance [15].
While much is known about the major microbes responsible for diseases, there are still many undiagnosed cases of infectious disease. It has been estimated that as many as three-fifths of the deaths from acute gastroenteritis per year in the United States are caused by an infectious organism of unknown etiology [16]. Four of the major causes of food-borne infections (Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Cyclospora cayetanensis, Figure 2) were only recently recognized as causes of food-borne illness [16].
Diseases that have recently appeared or that are growing in incidence are classified as emerging infectious diseases [see Additional File 4]. Emerging infectious organisms often encounter hosts with no prior exposure and thus represent a novel challenge to the host's immune system. Morse [17] identified six general factors in emergence of infectious disease: ecological changes, human demographics and behavior, international travel, technology and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and breakdown in public health measures. A comprehensive review by Taylor, Latham, and Woolhouse [18] identified zoonotic status as one of the strongest risk factors for disease emergence. Roughly 75% of emerging pathogens are zoonotic, and zoonoses are twice as likely to be considered emerging as non-zoonoses.
Zoonoses are a special class of pathogens as they co-evolve with the reservoir host, not with humans. Although not always the case, when zoonotic pathogens infect humans they have a tendency to cause severe disease, much like a commensal microorganism that infects unusual areas of the body [19]. Zoonoses can be broken down into two basic groups: those spread by direct contact with the infected animal and those spread via an intermediate vector [20]. Zoonoses can infect humans through many vectors. Members of the genus Hantavirus are spread by rats [21], West Nile virus by mosquitoes [22], and Campylobacter species by family pets [23]. In 2003, there was an outbreak of monkeypox (Figure 4) in the Midwestern United States, which was attributed to the importation of pet animals [24]. Viruses, protozoa, and bacteria can all be transmitted either directly or via a vector. However, these groups are clearly differentiated on a phylogenetic level. All zoonotic members of the families Flaviviridae and Togaviridae (Figure 6) are transmitted via an intermediate vector, while all zoonotic members of the families Arenaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Filoviridae (Figure 5) are transmitted through direct contact. Almost all zoonotic proteobacteria are transmitted through direct contact as well [20]. Of all the agents infectious to humans, a majority are zoonotic in origin [18].
Several viruses responsible for human epidemics have made a transition from animal host to human host and are now transmitted from human to human. Human immunodeficiency virus (Figure 7), responsible for the AIDS epidemic, is one example [25]. Although it has yet to be proven, it is suspected that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS coronavirus (Figure 6), also resulted from a species jump [26]. For many years, Robert G. Webster has studied the importance of influenza viruses in wild birds as a major reservoir of influenza viruses and has clarified their role in the evolution of pandemic strains that infect humans and lower animals [27].
Intriguingly, it appears that whenever a virus (or any other pathogen or pest) is eradicated another appears to fill the environmental niche. For example, in regions where the wild-type poliovirus (Figure 6) has been eliminated, non-polio enteroviruses have been associated with outbreaks of paralytic disease that clinically exhibit symptoms of poliomyelitis. The most common non-polio enteroviral causes of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) are human coxsackieviruses A7 and A9 and human enterovirus 71 (Figure 6). The poliovirus epidemics that emerged in the mid 19th century are now believed to have arisen not due to a change in the properties of the virus, but due to an improvement of public sanitation and personal hygiene, which delayed the acquisition of enteric virus infection from infancy to childhood. Since maternal antibodies protected infants, they usually underwent silent immunizing infections, whereas when older children were infected they more often suffered paralytic poliomyelitis [28].
Proteobacteria are important plant and animal pathogens, and it is interesting that proteobacterial plant pathogens are not clustered on the phylogenetic tree, but are observed in alpha, beta, and gamma subdivisions (Figure 2). Some plant and animal pathogen species share the same genus classification (e.g. Ralstonia and Pseudomonas), and for at least one species, Burkholderia cepacia, different subspecies are plant and human pathogens. In viruses, plant and animal pathogens are generally found in distinct families, with the notable exception of the families Rhabdoviridae (Figure 5) and Reoviridae (Figure 7) that harbor both. Most plant-specific virus families are not shown in Figures 4,5,6,7, but for rice alone at least ten unrelated virus species have been reported to infect cultures worldwide. The overall economical effect of plant pathogens has been estimated to reduce crop production by one fifth [29]. Foot-and-mouth disease almost destroyed the beef industry in the United Kingdom and losses were very high. Bird flu in South East Asia affected the poultry industry severely. Influenza A is a bird virus that jumped from birds via pigs to humans and as a human pathogen has a large impact on the economy [30].
Bioterrorism can be defined as an attack or threat of an attack using bioweapons on humans and/or their assets to create fear, to intimidate, to inflict harm, and/or affect economic well being. Such acts may be motivated by political, religious, ecological, or other ideological objectives. Any microorganism or toxin capable of causing disease or harm in humans, plants, or animals has the potential for illicit use and thus the list of potential agents could be vast. However, not all organisms or toxins make useful biological weapons. Displaying biological weapons from a phylogenetic perspective provides insight into how organisms that have been historically used as biowarfare agents are related to important human and agricultural pathogens and also provides insight into other similar organisms that might be considered as weapons in the future. The properties that make organisms amenable for use as biological weapons have been discussed extensively [31-39]. The most important features include: 1) accessibility; 2) consistent ability to cause death or disability; 3) culturability; 4) possibility for large scale production; 5) stability and ability to retain potency during transport and storage; 6) delivery potential; 7) stability and retention of potency after dissemination; and 8) infectivity and toxicity [39].
The infectious agents considered by the NIAID to have high potential for bioterror use are listed in Additional File 5 [see Additional File 5]. Validated and potential bioweapons agents are listed in Additional File 6 [see Additional File 6]. Agents that have been used to commit biocrimes [2] are in Additional File 7 [see Additional File 7]. The pathogens regulated by the HHS and the USDA are shown in Additional File 9 [see Additional File 9] and Additional file 10 [see Additional File 10], respectively. In addition to infectious microbes, toxins derived from biological sources are contained on these lists. We identified the biological source of each toxin, and listed the source organism in the Additional File containing the toxin.
All 11 regulated toxins can be found on the HHS Select Agent list [see Additional File 9] and five are also regulated by the USDA [see Additional File 10]. The regulated toxins (four small molecules and seven peptides or proteins) are produced by a wide variety of organisms: five are produced by bacteria [40-42], two by fungi [43,44], two by plants [45,46], one by an animal [47], and one by a protist [48]. The bacteria that produce toxins are indicated in Figure 2 and the eukaryotic toxin producers are shown in Figure 3. The conotoxins are a collection of five families of related peptide toxins produced by the various species of snails in the genus Conus [47]. The two fungal toxins, diacetoxyscirpenol and T-2 toxin, are produced by multiple species of the genus Fusarium [43,44]. Of the five regulated bacterial toxins, four are peptides or proteins and tetrodotoxin [49] is a small molecule. Tetrodotoxin is produced by a variety of gammaproteobacteria that colonize the puffer fish [50]. These toxins are relevant both due to concern that they may cause outbreaks of disease through accidental food contamination and because they are potential bioweapons. According to the CDC [51], an average of 110 cases of botulism, caused by a bacterial toxin (Figure 2), are reported each year. Interestingly, numbers of cases of food-borne and infant botulism have not changed significantly in recent years, but instances of wound-botulism have increased primarily due to the use of black-tar heroin, especially in California. Ricin is a toxin produced by the plant Ricinus communis (Figure 3) [46]. When prepared as a weapon, there are three methods of delivery: ingestion, injection, or inhalation [41]. One of the most famous documented uses of ricin was in the assassination of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian defector who died three days after being shot with a ricin pellet [41,52].
Pathogens that can be genetically manipulated [see Additional File 8] represent a unique bioterrorist threat, particularly as technology to genetically alter microbes becomes more commonplace. For the purposes of this work, viruses considered as having a high potential danger for bioterrorist engineering were derived from the literature reports and from the authors' judgment balancing the considerations of terror potential with the technical difficulty of use.
DNA viruses (Figure 4) with large genomes can be manipulated in culture, and are susceptible to engineering events such as insertion of genes not normally present in viral genomes. For example, the entire orthopoxvirus genus of the poxvirus family is considered to have high potential for bioengineering because of a much-publicized paper that describes the engineering of an orthopox member, ectromelia virus, to express mouse interleukin-4, resulting in a virus with extraordinary virulence [53]. Another member of the orthopoxvirus genus, vaccinia virus, is commonly used in molecular biology research and is extensively used in vaccines and vaccine research [54-57]. Thus, because they are highly infectious, will tolerate inserted genes, and can be manipulated easily in culture, poxviruses must be considered high-risk agents for acts of bioengineering. Mutations to create vaccine- and drug-resistant strains are also possible in other large-genome DNA viruses. Adeno-associated viruses are small DNA viruses that are members of the family Parvoviridae. They are satellite viruses that depend upon the presence of their helper DNA viruses, including members of the families Adenoviridae and Herpesviridae, for replication. Like vaccinia virus, adeno-associated viruses have been used extensively as vectors for gene therapy, and therefore represent a risk for genetic modification and subsequent terrorist use.
RNA-genome viruses are naturally more resistant to insertion of genes, but can be made resistant to drugs and potentially even to vaccines by introduction of mutations. Most critically, RNA viruses may be created in the laboratory by total chemical synthesis to generate active virus particles or reconstituted from cloned DNA. Total chemical synthesis was demonstrated recently for poliovirus (Figure 6) [58]. Since this publication in 2002, the technology to chemically synthesize viruses has advanced substantially. Chemical synthesis of RNA viruses would eliminate the need for the bioterrorist to obtain stock cultures and would allow creation of any wild-type or mutant strain of virtually any virus. Other positive-strand RNA viruses (Figure 6) that have been reconstituted from cloned DNA samples include Kunjin virus [59], human rhinovirus [60], foot-and-mouth disease virus [61], transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a coronavirus [62,63], all three genera of the family Flaviviridae [64], and a variety of plant and insect viruses [65,66]. Thus, the positive-stranded viruses must be considered a high-risk area for bioengineering, where the relative risk for each virus must be considered roughly equivalent to the terrorist potential inherent to the virus.
Negative-strand RNA viruses (Figure 5) can also be reconstituted by total chemical synthesis or from cloned genomic DNA by a reverse genetics approach [67]. Many negative-strand RNA viruses, including ebolaviruses, Lake Victoria marburgvirus, Hantaan virus and Lassa virus, are important human pathogens and potential bioterrorist agents. Influenza virus A is a particularly noteworthy negative-strand RNA virus due to its potential to cause pandemic disease, the availability of stock cultures of many strains, and the potential for total chemical synthesis by reverse genetics techniques [68].
For bacteria, if virulence factors have previously been modified successfully in a species, that species was considered to have a high potential for bioengineering and was included on the chart. However, numerous other methods for engineering bacterial genomes exist. Bacterial genomes consist of one or more chromosomes and additional genetic information may exist in the form of plasmids. Plasmids replicate independently of the chromosomal DNA and can be transferred between bacteria through transformation. Genes encoding virulence factors may be found in either chromosomes or plasmids. In one example of an early bioengineering event, the selective growth of an antibiotic-sensitive species with an antibiotic-resistant species in the presence of the antibiotic resulted in transference of resistance. Current techniques allow for the splicing of genes encoding virulence factors from one species followed by insertion into another. However, the complexity of the bacterial genome makes it difficult to successfully transfer a gene with a high rate of expression.
This manuscript provides a visualization of the results obtained from use of the Microbial Rosetta Stone Database, a database that uses a new data model and novel computational tools to synthesize information on important human, animal, and plant pathogens [1]. Information on critical pathogens and diseases has been collected from many sources. Organism names from all lists were converted to NCBI species names and diseases were linked to particular pathogens, which facilitated computational analysis and linkage to public genomic databases. This database should facilitate access to information on disease-causing organisms and toxins. The database can be accessed at .
Agent lists were collected from various sources as described in more detail for each Additional File below. Government agency lists (Additional Files 1, 2, 5, 9, and 10) were taken directly from the specified agencies, while additional tables were compiled using cited literature. Organism names from all lists were converted to NCBI species names. This included changes from species synonyms to NCBI-accepted nomenclature and expansion from Genus to Genus species (e.g. Shigella to Shigella dysenteriae or Shigella sonnei) to represent the most important species (when known). Where possible, disease names were associated with the name of the most predominant organism that causes the disease. The Additional Files contain taxonomic information, the NCBI name of the agent and any well-known synonyms, and accession numbers for the complete genome of each agent (if available).
Names of the infectious agents listed in the Additional Files were placed in tree-structure drawings shown in the figures that display the biological relatedness of the organisms. Cellular life forms were organized according to currently accepted phylogenetic relationships. Bacterial phylogeny (Figure 2) is based on work by Hugenholtz et al. [69]. The eukaryotic phylogeny tree (Figure 3) is based on ribosomal and housekeeping gene sequence analysis [70]. The branching order presented in Figure 3 should be considered tentative as the on-going recognition of additional protist lineages is likely to alter the topology of the eukaryotic tree in the near future [71]. The phylogeny of DNA viruses (Figure 4) was derived primarily from the work of Iyer, Aravind & Koonin [72]. The common origin of RNA viruses and their tentative relationships (Figures 5,6,7) is based on an extensive analysis of their RNA-dependent RNA- or DNA-polymerase (manuscript in preparation). The RNA virus phylogenetic trees were created using maximum parsimony on protein sequences. The branching of double-stranded RNA viruses is for now left unresolved in light of their apparent polyphyly [73]. The symbol key is shown in Figure 1 and symbols are used in the other figures to link the pathogens in the figures to Additional Files.
The agents listed in Additional File 1 [see Additional File 1] were taken from a list maintained by the WHO. The WHO tracks the occurrence of morbidity and mortality of global infectious diseases. Because of the great disparity in infectious disease prevalence between developed and developing nations, the WHO divides the world into demographically developed nations (including the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and nations of the former Soviet Union) and demographically developing nations (including India, China, other Asian nations, Pacific island nations, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East) [3]. The WHO lists leading causes of death worldwide by disease categories. The disease can be caused by multiple diverse organisms or co-infections of different organisms, as is the case for acute respiratory disease, or by specific organisms, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or tuberculosis. In the former case, we identified the most prominent organisms responsible for the disease for display in Additional File 1.
The CDC-notifiable-disease list represents those diseases that offer the greatest threat to public health in the United States. Additional File 2 [see Additional File 2] lists the agents on this list. There are no set criteria for inclusion on the notifiable disease list; rather, the list is created by the CDC in cooperation with state health departments. As diseases occur less frequently and new diseases emerge, the notifiable disease list changes. An up-to-date version of the list can be found online on the CDC website [74]. The online list provides links to case definitions of each disease, including the etiological agent(s) responsible. In cases where the etiological agent was not listed or was unspecific (i.e. Brucella species), further research was done to determine an etiological agent and literature used is cited in legend for Additional File 2.
The most common causative agents of food- and water-borne illness were taken from a publication by Tauxe [75] and are listed in Additional File 3 [see Additional File 3]. Hubálek [20] published a list that constitutes a representative subset of emerging infectious diseases, which was used as the basis for Additional File 4 [see Additional File 4]. The complete list of all species classified as emerging is substantial [18,76]. The number of pathogens listed in the emerging disease table at  is significantly larger than that found in Additional File 4.
Additional File 5 [see Additional File 5]was taken from The NIAID Strategic Plan For Biodefense Research, which lists agents with potential for "high morbidity and mortality; potential for person-to-person transmission, directly or by vector; low infective dose and high infectivity by aerosol, with commensurate ability to cause large outbreaks; ability to contaminate food and water supplies; lack of a specific diagnostic test and/or effective treatment; lack of a safe and effective vaccine; potential to cause anxiety in the public and in health care workers; and the potential to be weaponized [77]."
The properties that make organisms amenable for use as biological weapons have been discussed extensively [31,32]. For the purposes of the database, we have categorized microorganisms or toxins as validated bioweapons if they have been documented as used, or prepared for use, as biological weapons [78]. Potential bioweapons are defined as agents that have some properties that are considered useful as bioweapons or agents for terrorism, or that have been the subject of serious bioweapons research and development [31,39]. Greenwood et al. used a hierarchical ranking of 50 infectious agents and toxins of biological origin [31] to classify agents as potentially useful biological weapons. Greenwood et al.'s 23 highest scoring agents overlapped substantially with our list of validated bioweapons and these are shown in Additional File 6 [see Additional File 6].
The agents listed in Additional File 6 and additional agents listed in Additional File 7 [see Additional File 7] could be used in commission of a biocrime. Biocrimes are similar to traditional crimes that harm specific individuals except that the weapon is biological in nature. A number of biological agents have been used to commit biocrimes [52,79-96], and the potential list of agents that can be used is enormous. Indeed, it is impossible to anticipate the next organism that will be used for illicit purposes. Documented cases and accessibility were the criteria for choice of agents in Additional File 7.
The high potential for bioengineering category [see Additional File 8] includes both organisms that have been actually modified in biological weapons research programs in the past, and organisms with properties that make them amenable to future engineering. Placement in the latter category was based upon published reports of bioengineering for peaceful purposes [53-58] and the author's (DJE) analysis. The agents on the HHS list are shown in Additional File 9. HHS regulates the possession of biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety. HHS's Select Agent Program [97] regularly reviews and updates the list of select agents and critical human pathogens [98].
The USDA is required by federal law to protect animal and plant health. High Consequence Livestock Pathogens and Toxins are agents that the USDA considers to have the potential to pose a severe threat to animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products [99]. These organisms are listed in Additional File 10 [see Additional File 10]. The pathogens on the HHS [see Additional File 9] and USDA lists include agents that span all domains of life, including 20 bacteria, 48 viruses, four fungi, two protists, one prion, and 11 toxins. A significant number of these agents appear on both the HHS and USDA lists.
DJE conceived of the study, organized the structure and contributed to the research and writing, and was overall responsible for the development of the research and the manuscript. RS, VS, TAH, KH, JAM, and JRW contributed to the literature analysis, organization of written sections, and writing of the manuscript. PW conducted extensive research, analysis, and constructed and linked the tables. BB contributed the sections on biocrimes and bioterrorism. CB-O contributed the viral taxonomy components of the manuscript. CM contributed the phylogenetic organization sections, plant pathogen research, and generated the figures.

22. HIV Epidemiology in Africa: Weak Variables and Tendentiousness Generate Wobbly Conclusions
In their attempt to defend heterosexual transmission as the driving force for HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa and dismiss the evidence for unsafe injections (or other percutaneous exposures) as a major source of HIV transmission [1,2], Lopman and colleagues [3] assert that “unsafe medical injections can be confidently excluded as a major source of HIV infection” in Manicaland, Zimbabwe. Their methods and results are glaringly insufficient to generate the confidence they seek. Confidence requires thorough evaluation, which was not done in their study [3].
Although the authors quantified the number of sexual partners, they failed to quantify the number of injections [3], which undermines the likelihood of detecting an effect of injections, as does adding the statistical noise of “needle pricks” (how was that question phrased?) to injections. We find it difficult to believe that the authors were unaware of either the dose-dependency issue or the implications of using a weak measure of a vector that they are transparently invested in dismissing. In addition, the recall interval was inordinately long (up to three years). It is unreasonable to expect accurate data from subjects who are not multiply prompted to stimulate recall.
As a secondary issue, their adjustment of the risk ratio associating HIV with injections against age is problematic. Adjusting a causal variable against age (which is a proxy for causal variables) may reduce the true association. Their Table 1 shows that injections in women vary by age in the same pattern that HIV incidence varies by age. It might be that when they adjust for age, the risk ratios for age capture the association, leaving a diminished association for injections.
Confidence in their report is also undermined by their approach to their own finding that sexual behavior was unrelated to risk of incident HIV. Indeed, using the same standard of evidence that the authors applied to their null medical-injection finding, the abstract, discussion, and press release information should also have proclaimed that sex was “confidently excluded” as a risk for HIV. Indeed, this would be consistent with the largest studies of HIV risk in Africa, including one in their own backyard (Manicaland) [4], which found little association of measured sexual behaviors with HIV risk. It would also be consistent with the many intervention studies reporting no benefit from condom-promotion programs [5], as well as with observation of the opposite trajectories of the HIV and STD epidemics observed in Zimbabwe [6].
Of additional concern is Lopman et al.'s finding that 13 of 67 individuals who seroconverted reported no sexual partners in the long inter-survey period. Indeed, their Table 2 data show that women with no reported sexual partners have higher HIV incidence than women who report any partner during the three-year interval (1.56 HIV cases per 100 person-years [12/770] for the former compared to 1.21 [36/2975] for the latter). They reveal their a priori conviction by forcing this datum into the procrustean sexual bed, inferring that it is explainable by unreported sexual activity rather than unreported or unmeasured percutaneous exposure. The authors blame underreporting of sexual behavior without using techniques shown to dramatically improve valid reporting [7].
Despite this remarkable lack of association in their women respondents between HIV incidence and number of sexual partners, they counterintuitively suggest (in the patient summary) that the important issue is sexual transmission. It seems to us that if sex doesn't appear to explain high HIV incidence, then one should recommend looking for what does, which the authors do not do. Rather than relying on the case-control approach, what is needed is intensive contact tracing (with viral sequencing of HIV specimens from index cases and their infected contacts to elucidate transmission relationships [8]) and a rigorous inventory of possible exposures and vectors [7]. The contact tracing and conscientious environmental risk probing of recent public-health responses to avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome are an example of a useful and superior step to the case-control approach.
In brief, what is truly driving HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa will not be resolved by hastily implemented weak variables or by dismissive comments about Africans' self-reports of sexual behavior, especially comments unencumbered by data. Africans, science, and public health deserve better research [7].

23. Inhibition of SARS-CoV 3C-like Protease Activity by Theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1,2). From November 1, 2002 to June 18, 2003, a total of 8465 probable SARS cases were reported to the World Health Organization from 29 countries, and 801 people died from this disease. The case–fatality proportion was ∼10%. Although the spread of the virus has been averted, the re-emergence of SARS is still in question (3–6).
Like other related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing single-stranded RNA of positive polarity. Coronaviruses have the largest genomes known (∼30 kb) among RNA viruses [7]. The genome of SARS-CoV comprises one open reading frame (ORF) encoding two overlapping replicase polyproteins, polyprotein-1a (pp1a, ∼450 kDa) and poplyprotein-1ab (pp1ab, ∼750 kDa), responsible for virus replication (7). The rest of the genome comprises at least five ORFs encoding structural proteins and other genes with putative functions (8,9). Proteolytic processing, especially the processing of replicase polyproteins, is one of the crucial steps in the life cycle of many positive-stranded RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. All coronaviruses encode a papline-like protease (PLP) and a chymotrypsin-like (3CLPro) protease for proteolytic procession during virus maturation (10). Studies on other coronaviruses have shown that the PLP protein cleaves at no less than two sites on the pp1a polyprotein and that the 3CLPro protease cleaves at least 11 inter-domain sites on the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins [7]. Thus, the 3CLPro protease of SARS-CoV has been considered as an important molecular target for anti-SARS-CoV drug discovery and developments. In this study, after screening of a natural product library and further confirmation, we found that SARS-3CLPro could be inhibited by compounds that are abundant in teas. We also examined crude extracts from various teas and a panel of representative natural products in teas for their inhibitory activities against SARS-3CLPro.
Total RNA extracted from a throat swab of a SARS patient was provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Taipei, Taiwan. All RNA samples were handled under bio-safety level 2 (BSL2) regulations. Two primers, 5′-GGCGGAATTCGCCTCTACCAACCACCACAGA-3′ and 5′-GGCGGAATTCA AAGCATCCAATGATGAGTGCC-3′, were used for reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) to synthesize the cDNA of SARS-3CLPro using Ready-to-Go RT–PCR Beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR cycle used for the amplification of cDNA of SARS-3CLPro was as follows: 94°C for 5 min, 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 58°C for 3 min, 72°C for 2 min and 72°C for 10 min. A full-length 3CLPro of SARS coronavirus was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Following cleavage by thrombin, 3CLPro was purified to homogeneity. A 15mer peptide with sequence H2N-SITSAVLQSGFRKMA-COOH corresponding to an autocleavage site of the SARS-3CLPro was synthesized and used for protease cleavage activity assay. The highly purified protein was shown by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to exhibit proteolytic activity in trans.
The Pure Natural Products Library used to screen for 3CLPro inhibition was obtained from MicroSource Discovery Systems, Inc., Gaylordsville, CT. It consists of a unique collection of 720 pure natural products. The collection includes simple and complex oxygen heterocycles, alkaloids, sequiterpenes, diterpenes, pentacyclic triterpenes, sterols and many other diverse representatives. Initially, 10 different compounds were pooled, and the mixtures were tested for their inhibitory activities against SARS-3CLPro. Positive pools were then deconvoluted and single pure compounds that were able to inhibit >50% of peptide cleavage at 10 µM were scored as hits. Other compounds were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Theaflavin (TF1), TF2 [a mixture of TF-2A (theaflavin-3-gallate) and TF-2B (theaflavin-3′-gallate)] and theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3) were kind gifts from Dr Yu-Chih Liang, School of Medical Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.
Tea liquors were prepared from oolong tea, green tea, black tea and Puer tea (also called pu-er or pu-erh) samples as 2% (w/v) tea solutions. The water extracts of four different types of tea leaves were prepared by shaking for 10 min in boiling hot water in thermal flasks. The extracts were then filtered through a Millex-GS 0.22 µm filter (Millipore, Malsheim, France) to remove particulate matter. The water extracts were then evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain viscous masses. These materials were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against SARS-3CLPro.
A general cysteine protease inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, protease inhibitor as positive control), was obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO). This compound was tested for its inhibitory activities against SARS-3CLPro in the peptide cleavage assay. The activities of the proteases were measured in the absence or presence of different concentrations of these general inhibitors. The enzyme (2 µM) was pre-incubated with chemicals for 30 min. Peptide was then added at 100 µM to the reaction, and mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The potency of the inhibitors was calculated. The HPLC analysis condition is: a C18 RP guard column (250 × 4.6 mm × 5 µm, Agilent Zorbax Extend). This method was chosen because it gave the best resolution among several methods that were tested. The column temperature was ambient, and the elution (0.8 ml/min) was performed using a solvent system comprising solvents A [10 MM NH4OAc, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)] and B (acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) mixed using a gradient starting with 100% A, linearly decreasing to 10% A in 8 min, to 100% A in 16 min, and held at 100% A for 23 min. The injection volume was 40 ml. The UV detector was set at 214 nm.
The development of a fluorescent protease activity assay has been reported previously (7). The enhanced fluorescence due to cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate peptide (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) catalyzed by the protease was monitored at 538 nm with excitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent from ThermoLabsystems, Sweden). The fluorimetric assay was used to determine the IC50 of identified inhibitors on SARS 3CLPro activity. The protease was stored in the buffer containing 12 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at −70°C before use.
The spectrum collection, a library of 720 drugs and natural products, was screened for 3CLPro inhibitory activity. A flowchart of the screening procedure is shown in Fig. 1. Initially, 10 different compounds were pooled, and the 72 mixtures were then tested for their inhibitory activities against SARS-3CLPro. The HPLC assay was used in the primary screening because many compounds in the library are chromogenic. Single compounds in the positive pools were then evaluated for their activities. Two compounds, tannic acid and TF2B, were found to be active against 3CLPro (Fig. 2). Tannic acid is a water-soluble polyphenol present in plant food such as tea, red wine, beer and nuts. In addition, tea polyphenols and many tannin components are thought to be anticarcinogenic (14,15).
Since many other polyphenols related to tannic acid and TF2B are also present in various kinds of teas, we decided to examine the inhibition of activity by various tea extracts and several well known pure ingredients present in teas. Thus, water extracts from different types of teas were prepared and evaluated for their inhibitory activities against 3CLPro. As shown in Table 1, extracts from black and Puer teas inhibited 3CLPro activity while those from green or oolong teas did not. We further tested the possible involvement of several known ingredients present in teas, including caffeine, theophylline, catechin (C), epigallocatechin (EGC), (—)-epigallocatechin gallte (EGCg), epicatechin (EC), epicatechin gallate (ECg), TF1, TF2, TF2B, tannic acid and TF3. As shown in Table 1, the results showed that methylxanthine (caffeine and theophylline) did not influence 3CLPro activity; catechins, including C, EC, ECg, EGC and EGCg, present in green tea (unfermented) and oolong tea (partial fermented) also did not inhibit 3CLPro activity. Our results indicated that tannic acid, TF2B and TF3 are 3CLPro inhibitors as revealed by the fluorogenic substrate assay (Fig. 3). TF2A was not tested because of its unavailability.
The natural product screened library consisted of simple and complex oxygen heterocycles, alkaloids, sequiterpenes, diterpenes, pentacyclic triterpenes, sterols and many other diverse representatives. Numerous black tea polyphenols (especially those of TF1, TF2 and TF3) were found to inhibit 3CLPro. In black tea, TF3 was the most abundant (1.05%) followed by TF2A (0.34%), TF2B (0.11%) and TF1 (0.08%) (16). It is interesting to note that TF3 contained two gallate groups attached to the 3,3′ positions as shown in Fig. 4b. TF2A and TF2B, on the other hand, consisted of only one gallate group attached either to the 3 or the 3′ positions, respectively (Fig. 4b). In contrast, no gallate group was attached to TF1. Results in Table 1, indicating that the gallate group attached to the 3′ position to TF2B and TF3, might be important for interaction with the 3CLPro active site. EC, EGCg, ECG and EGC were much less active (IC50 ≥ 100 µM) than theaflavins.
Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are major causes of upper respiratory tract illness in animals including humans. It has been demonstrated that a novel coronavirus causes SARS. The main protease, frequently called 3C-like protease (3CLPro), has been identified as an attractive drug target (17). Of the 720 natural products screened in this study, tannic acid (Fig. 4a) and TF2B were identified using the HPLC proteolytic assay to inhibit 50% of the proteolytic acitivity of 3CLPro at concentrations ≤10 µM. Both tannic acid and TF2B belong to the group of natural polyphenols found in teas. Low concentrations of tannic acid were found to inhibit proteases including tissue-type plasminogen activator, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and plasmin activity [13]. Over 300 different kinds of tea are now produced, but they are classified into three main forms: green tea is manufactured by drying fresh tea leaves, with emphasis on the prevention of oxidation of the tea polyphenols during the manufacturing process. In contrast, the manufacture of black tea is characterized by a high degree of fermentation, which produces a series of chemical condensations among the ingredients present in tea. Oolong tea is partially fermented, and the tea compositions are more similar to those found in green tea (18). In evaluating different types of tea, we found that extracts from several different types of tea, including Puer and black tea, could inhibit 3CLPro activity while green or oolong tea could not. However, the chemical composition in Puer tea is very complex and it is difficult to isolate pure ingredients for structural identification. Purification and identification of Puer tea ingredients should be carried out in a separate study.
We next examined whether other well-known ingredients present in tea could also inhibit 3CLPro activity. We found that methylxanthine (caffeine and theophylline) and catechins (EGCg, EC, C, ECg and EGC) were not able to inhibit 3CLPro activity at concentrations up to 100 µM (Table 1). However, TF1, TF2 and TF3 were more potent 3CLPro inhibitors than catechins in green tea. During the fermentation step in the production of black tea, most of the catechins are oxidized and condensed into theaflavins through dimerization and into thearubigins through polymerization. Green tea contains ∼30% of catechins (dry mass base) while black tea contains ∼9% of catechins and 4% of theaflavins (19). In another study, Leung et al. (16) reported that TF3 was the most abundant (1.05%) theaflavin in black tea followed by TF2A (0.34%), TF2B (0.11%) and TF1 (0.08%). Tannic acid is a class of polyphenolic in plants but the quantification of its levels in green or black tea is difficult because tannic acid constitutes a wide range of polymers with mol. wts of 500–3000 Da.
It is interesting to note that TF2B and TF3 are more potent inhibitors of 3CLPro than TF1 (Table 1). Unlike TF2B and TF3, TF1 does not contain a gallate group (Fig. 4b). Thus, the addition of a gallate group attached at the 39 position to TF2B and TF3 might be important for their inhibitory activity against 3CLPro. These results suggest that TF2B and TF3 might be good starting points for the design of more active inhibitors for the 3CLPro encoded by SARS-CoV.
Finally, this study has identified three compounds (TF2B, TF3 and tannic acid) that are effective 3CLPro inhibitors (IC50 ≤10 µM). These compounds are abundant in the extract of black tea (16,19). Black tea is a popular beverage in the world. Results from this study warrant further investigation to examine the effect of these natural products in inhibition of SARS-CoV replication in cell culture. Clark et al. reported that theaflavins extracted from black tea were able to neutralize bovine coronavirus and rotavirus infections (20). Thus, it will be very interesting to evaluate, in a separate study, whether drinking black tea can prevent or alleviate the infection of an enteric form of coronavirus since SARS-CoV is known to actively replicate in the intestinal tract (21).

24. Receptor and viral determinants of SARS-coronavirus adaptation to human ACE2
SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an acute pulmonary syndrome that, when it emerged in the winter of 2002–2003, resulted in the death of approximately 800 individuals, close to 10% of those infected (Drosten et al, 2003; Fouchier et al, 2003; Ksiazek et al, 2003; Kuiken et al, 2003). Despite concerns that SARS-CoV would re-emerge, last winter (2003–2004), only a handful of individuals were found infected by the virus. These individuals appeared to have much less severe symptoms, and no secondary transmission was observed (Liang et al, 2004; Peiris et al, 2004; Song et al, 2005). Severe cases of SARS were also reported in 2004, but these resulted from laboratory infections (Normile, 2004).
The coronavirus spike (S) protein mediates infection of receptor-bearing cells (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Holmes, 2003; Hofmann and Pohlmann, 2004). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and binds the SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity (Li et al, 2003). Several lines of evidence suggest that ACE2 is a physiologically relevant receptor during infection. Tissue expression of the receptor corresponds to the localization of virus in infected individuals and animals (Harmer et al, 2002; Chan et al, 2004; Ding et al, 2004; Hamming et al, 2004). Also, the efficiency of infection in humans, mice, and rats correlates with the ability of the ACE2 of each species to support viral replication (Li et al, 2004; Subbarao et al, 2004; Wentworth et al, 2004). Antibodies that block ACE2 association (Sui et al, 2004) protect mice against infection (Sui et al, 2005). Finally, although many cell lines do not express ACE2, most cell lines shown to support SARS-CoV infection or replication detectably express this receptor (Hofmann et al, 2004; Nie et al, 2004). Although DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN, CD209L) and DC-SIGN (CD209) have recently been shown to enhance infection of ACE2-expressing cells (Jeffers et al, 2004; Marzi et al, 2004; Yang et al, 2004), these proteins do not appear to mediate efficient infection in the absence of ACE2 (Jeffers et al, 2004; Marzi et al, 2004).
Unlike many type I fusion proteins, including those of other coronaviruses, the S protein of SARS-CoV is not cleaved in the virus-producing cell (Xiao et al, 2003; Moore et al, 2004). However, two domains corresponding to the S1 and S2 proteins of processed coronaviruses can be defined (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). The S1 domain mediates receptor association, whereas the S2 domain is membrane-associated and likely undergoes structural rearrangements that mediate membrane fusion. A discrete receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein has been defined at residues 318–510 of the S1 domain (Xiao et al, 2003; Babcock et al, 2004; Wong et al, 2004). This RBD binds ACE2 with higher affinity than does the full S1 domain (Wong et al, 2004).
Early cases of SARS in 2002 were reported to have occurred in animal traders and restaurant workers handling wild mammals, and SARS-CoV has been isolated from two such mammals, palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) (Guan et al, 2003). Palm civets have also been implicated in the minor 2003–2004 SARS outbreak (Zhong, 2004). The sequences of the S-protein genes of 13 viruses isolated from palm civets, and one from raccoon dogs, have been determined (Guan et al, 2003; Song et al, 2005). Interestingly, the RBDs of these animal S proteins are highly conserved except residue 479, which varies between asparagine and basic amino acids, but differ at several positions from the RBDs of viruses isolated during the 2002–2003 outbreak. Although different from palm-civet-derived RBDs, the latter RBDs were themselves highly conserved in the more than 100 S-protein genes obtained during the severe human outbreak (He et al, 2004; Zhang et al, 2004). Full sequence has also been published for two S-protein genes obtained during the mild 2003–2004 outbreak (He et al, 2004; Song et al, 2005). These genes are nearly identical and contain elements common to S protein isolated during the earlier human outbreak and to that isolated from palm civets.
Here we describe the S-protein-binding domain of human ACE2 by characterizing chimeras of human and rat ACE2. By introducing four residues of human ACE2 into rat ACE2, we convert this receptor, which supports little or no S-protein-mediated infection, into a receptor that binds the S1 domain and supports infection, with efficiency close to that of human ACE2. By characterizing additional ACE2 variants, we localize the S-protein-binding domain primarily to α-helix 1 of ACE2 and to a loop leading to β-sheet 5. We then show that a representative S protein from the mild 2003–2004 outbreak, and one from palm civets, mediates more efficient infection of cells expressing palm-civet ACE2 compared to cells expressing human receptor. In contrast, S protein from the severe 2002–2003 outbreak efficiently binds and utilizes both receptors. Two regions of the S-protein-binding site on ACE2, and two residues in the RBD of these S proteins, largely determine these differences. Our data describe S-protein adaptations, and their receptor counterparts, that permit efficient infection of human cells. These adaptations, absolutely conserved during 2002–2003 outbreak, may in part account for the unusual severity of SARS.
We have previously shown that S-protein-mediated infection of cells expressing human ACE2 is substantially more efficient than that of cells expressing the same levels of rat ACE2 (Li et al, 2004). We first investigated whether this difference localized to the ACE2 enzymatic or collectrin domain. The latter domain is defined by its close homology with a small, kidney-expressed protein of the same name (Zhang et al, 2001). Figure 1A shows that a fusion protein comprising the SARS-CoV S1 domain and the Fc domain of human IgG1 (S1-Ig) efficiently precipitated human ACE2, as well as an ACE2 chimera with the human catalytic domain and the rat collectrin domain. In contrast, S1-Ig could not precipitate rat ACE2 or an ACE2 chimera with the rat catalytic domain and the human collectrin domain. The ability of these chimeric receptors to bind S1-Ig was also reflected in their ability to support S-protein-mediated infection (Figure 2C). These data indicate that differences in the ability of rat and human ACE2 to support infection are localized to the catalytic domain of the receptor.
Guided by the structure of the ACE2 catalytic domain (Towler et al, 2004), we made a series of human ACE2 variants in which one or a few solvent-exposed residues were altered to their rat ACE2 counterparts. Two variants consistently bound S1-Ig less efficiently than did wild-type human ACE2. Introduction of rat residues 82–84 (NFS), which include a glycosylation site at asparagine 82 not present in human ACE2, partially inhibited S1-Ig association (Figures 1B and 2A) and S-protein-mediated entry (Figure 2C). Alteration of lysine 353 to a histidine residue present on the rat receptor interfered more dramatically with S1-Ig association, and also partially inhibited S-protein-mediated entry. Introduction of human residues 82–84 (MYP) and lysine 353 into rat ACE2 resulted in substantial increases in S1-Ig binding, as assayed both by immunoprecipitation and by flow cytometry (Figure 2A and B). Combination of both sets of residues resulted in a rat ACE2 variant that bound S1-Ig and supported S-protein-mediated infection comparably to human ACE2 (Figure 2A–C). These data suggest that residues 82–84 and, more so, lysine 353 participate in S-protein association with human ACE2.
We subsequently altered a number of additional residues of human ACE2 in the vicinity of residues 82–84 and 353 to alanine or, in some cases, aspartic acid. Alteration of two residues on the first helix of ACE2, at lysine 31 and tyrosine 41, substantially interfered with the S1-Ig association, as did residues adjacent to lysine 353, at aspartic acid 355 and at arginine 357, both within ACE2 β-sheet 5 (Figure 3A). Figure 3B–D shows three views of the crystal structure of human ACE2, in which residues that convert rat ACE2 to an efficient SARS-CoV receptor are shown in red, and additional residues whose alteration interferes with S1-Ig association are shown in yellow. Green indicates residues whose alteration did not affect S1-Ig binding. The C-terminal collectrin domain is not well ordered in the structure, but is used here to position the molecule with respect to the cell membrane. As shown in the figures, the S-protein-binding site on ACE2 is localized above the deep cleft that harbors the catalytic site and on the upper left of the structure when viewed facing that cleft.
The crystal structure of ACE2 has been solved in two distinct conformations, an open one (Figure 3B–D) and a conformation in which the cleft is closed around the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (Dales et al, 2002; Towler et al, 2004). These two conformations likely reflect free and substrate-bound states of the enzyme, respectively. We investigated whether the large conformational change associated with inhibitor binding interfered with S1-Ig binding or S-protein-mediated infection. As previously reported, MLN-4760 inhibits ACE2 activity in the low nanomolar range (Dales et al, 2002), and no ACE2 enzymatic activity was detected in the presence of 100 nM inhibitor (Figure 4A). However, 100 nM MLN-4760 did not interfere with immunoprecipitation of ACE2 by S1-Ig, nor did this inhibitor interfere with S-protein-mediated infection (Figure 4B and C). Consistent with these observations, the distances among α and β carbons of residues 31, 41, 353, 355, and 357 in the S-protein-binding site of ACE2 varied by less than 0.4 Å between the inhibitor-bound and -unbound structures (Towler et al, 2004). In contrast, distances between these residues and residues across the cleft typically varied by greater than 6 Å in the two structures. These data suggest that the S-protein-binding region of ACE2 is not perturbed by inhibitors or substrates that induce large conformational changes in the receptor. Consistent with these studies, we have also observed, using the assay shown in Figure 4A, that S1-Ig does not interfere with the enzymatic activity of ACE2 (data not shown).
The S protein used in the studies above was obtained from a patient infected during the severe 2002–2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. Another outbreak, during the winter of 2003–2004, caused much less severe symptoms in the few individuals infected and resulted in no documented human-to-human transmissions (He et al, 2004; Liang et al, 2004; Zhong, 2004; Song et al, 2005). We compared an S protein of virus isolated during this latter outbreak (GD03T0013; accession number AY525636; denoted GD herein) with that of virus obtained during the 2002–2003 outbreak (TOR2; AY274119) and with that isolated from palm civets (SZ3; AY304486) (Guan et al, 2003; Marra et al, 2003; Rota et al, 2003; He et al, 2004; Song et al, 2005). Figure 5A shows that the S1 domains of all three S proteins efficiently bound palm-civet ACE2 (accession number AY881174), whereas only the S1 domain of TOR2 efficiently bound human ACE2. Of note, the S1 domain of virus isolated during the 2003–2004 outbreak bound palm-civet ACE2 much more efficiently than it bound human ACE2. We then investigated the RBD of each of these S-protein variants. The ability of these S1 domains to bind palm-civet and human ACE2 was reflected in the ability of their respective RBDs to bind these receptors (Figure 5B). We also assayed the ability of the entire S protein to mediate infection of cells expressing human or palm-civet ACE2. The efficiency of entry was consistent with the ability of the S1 domain of each variant to bind each ACE2 (Figure 6C). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the palm civet is a source of SARS-CoV, and suggest that the apparent lack of severity of disease during the 2003–2004 outbreak may be due in part to incomplete adaptation of GD virus to human ACE2.
The RBDs of TOR2 and SZ3 differ by four residues (Figure 6A). We investigated which of these residues contribute to the ability of TOR2 RBD to bind efficiently human ACE2. Each residue in the TOR2 RBD was altered to its SZ3 counterpart. Alteration of two residues, at positions 479 and 487, interfered with the association of the TOR2 RBD with human ACE2 (Figure 6B). Surface plasmon resonance studies further demonstrated a greater than 20-fold decrease of affinity for human ACE2 when either residue 479 or 487, but not when residue 344 or 360, is altered to its palm-civet counterpart (Table I and Supplementary Figure 2). Notably, alteration of threonine 487 to serine also affected the ability of the TOR2 RBD to associate with palm-civet ACE2 (Figure 6B). Introduction of TOR2 residues at 479 or 487 substantially increased the ability of the full SZ3 S protein to infect cells expressing human ACE2. Introduction of SZ3 residues at these positions into the TOR2 S protein resulted in a 2- to 3-fold decrease in infection of these cells (Figure 6C). These data suggest that adaptation of S protein to human ACE2 is facilitated by alteration of residue 479 to asparagine and of 487 to threonine.
We also investigated determinants on civet ACE2 that participate in its ability to facilitate efficient infection by GD and SZ3. Two regions within the S-protein-binding site differed significantly between human and palm-civet ACE2 (see Figure 7D and E). A region of α-helix 1 (residues 30–40) varied at six residues between human and civet ACE2. Likewise, a loop initiating ACE2 α-helix 3 differed by four residues (90–93). A glycosylation site at asparagine 90 of human ACE2 is part of this latter region and is not present in palm-civet ACE2. Figure 7A shows that the S1 domains of GD and SZ3 bound substantially more efficiently when either of these regions was introduced into human ACE2, and that introduction of both regions resulted in receptor binding comparable to that with wild-type palm-civet ACE2. These observations were also reproduced in infection assays (Figure 7B). These data demonstrate that residues within the S-protein-binding domain of ACE2 largely determine the efficiency with which GD and SZ3 S proteins bind and utilize human and palm-civet ACE2.
Figure 7C compares the ability of eight RBD variants to bind to human and civet ACE2, as well as to the chimeric molecules assayed in Figure 7A and to a point-mutation variant of palm-civet ACE2, in which aspartic acid 354 was altered to a glycine present in human ACE2. RBD variants were generated from that of TOR2 (left panels) or SZ3 (right panels), and altered at positions 479, 487, or both, as indicated. The panels of Figure 7C permit several conclusions. First, the rough equivalence between the left and right panels indicates that, as implied by Figure 6B and C, S-protein residues 479 and 487 account for most of the differences between TOR2 and SZ3 RBD. Second, no consistent differences were observed between palm-civet ACE2 and its variant with glycine at residue 354, indicating little or no contribution of this residue to S-protein association. Third, consistent with infection data in Figure 6C, the presence of threonine at residue 487 enhanced the affinity of most RBDs for civet and human ACE2, and for variants of these receptors. (Compare, for example, K479/S487 RBD variants with K479/T487 variants for their ability to precipitate each ACE2 variant.) Fourth, and in contrast, substitution of lysine 479 for asparagine in most contexts increased the ability of each RBD variant to associate with human, but not with palm-civet, ACE2. (Compare the binding of N479/T487 RBD with that of K479/T487 variants for binding to human ACE2 (lane 1) and palm-civet ACE2 (lane 6); likewise for N479/S487 and K479/S487 variants.) This enhancement was also observed for ACE2 chimeras containing human α-helix 1 residues (lanes 1 and 2), but not those of palm civet (lanes 3, 5, and 6), whereas residues 90–93 did not determine sensitivity to RBD residue 479. Fifth, consistent with infection data in Figure 7B and Supplementary Figure 3, all RBDs bound ACE2 variants bearing residues 90–93 of palm-civet ACE2 substantially more efficiently than they bound equivalent variants with human ACE2 residues at these positions (compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4 in each panel). Thus, the data of Figure 7C indicate that a lysine at S-protein residue 479 interferes with RBD association with human, but not palm-civet, ACE2. Supplementary Figure 4 shows data consistent with a steric interaction between lysine 31 of human ACE2 and lysine 479 of the SZ3 S protein. Our data also show that alteration of S-protein serine 487 to threonine increases RBD affinity for both human and civet ACE2. Finally, they suggest that no S protein studied has fully adapted to human ACE2 residues 90–93, consistent with a recent zoonotic transmission of the virus.
Figure 7D–F summarizes our findings. Figure 7D shows amino-acid sequences of regions critical to S-protein association for palm-civet, rat, and human ACE2. Figure 7E shows ACE2 oriented with the C-terminal membrane-associated collectrin domain facing away from the viewer. Red indicates residues whose alteration transformed rat ACE2 to an efficient SARS-CoV receptor. Orange indicates additional residues common to rat and human ACE2 whose alteration also interferes with S-protein association. Yellow indicates residues along the α-helix 1 ridge that are unique to palm-civet ACE2, and which permit efficient association with RBD isolates from palm civet and likely interact with lysine 479 of the palm-civet RBD. K31 of human ACE2, which interferes with palm-civet RBD lysine 479, is labeled with white text in Figure 7E. Four residues at the beginning of α-helix 4 that permit more efficient binding and infection by all S proteins assayed are shown in cyan, and the glycosylation site in this region, present in human but not palm-civet ACE2, is shown in green.
ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and is likely to play a critical role in viral replication in an infected host (Li et al, 2003; Hamming et al, 2004; Nie et al, 2004). Here we describe the S-protein-binding domain of ACE2. In particular, residues along the first α-helix, and lysine 353 and proximal residues at the N-terminus of β-sheet 5, participate in S-protein binding and in infection. By altering histidine 353 in rat ACE2 and modifying a glyosylation site that may alter the shape of α-helix 1, we converted rat ACE2 to an efficient receptor for SARS-CoV. This S-protein-binding region of ACE2 remains intact in the presence of an inhibitor that dramatically alters the overall conformation of ACE2 (Dales et al, 2002; Towler et al, 2004), consistent with the inability of this inhibitor to block infection, and with the inability of the S protein to modulate ACE2 activity.
Although there can be multiple constraints on interspecies transmission of viruses (Webby et al, 2004), S-protein alterations are sufficient to extend or alter the host range of a number of coronaviruses (Kuo et al, 2000; Casais et al, 2003; Haijema et al, 2003; Schickli et al, 2004). We have shown that entry is the primary barrier to SARS-CoV infection of murine cells (Li et al, 2004). These observations suggest that S-protein changes may be critical to or sufficient for the adaptation of SARS-CoV to human cells. Accordingly, we compared the S proteins derived from the 2002–2003 outbreak (TOR2), from the less severe 2003–2004 outbreak (GD), and from apparently healthy palm civets (SZ3) (Guan et al, 2003; He et al, 2004). Strikingly, the receptor-binding regions of each of these S proteins bound palm-civet ACE2 efficiently, but only that from the 2002–2003 outbreak bound human ACE2 with comparable efficiency. These data are consistent with the absence of human-to-human transmission during the 2003–2004 outbreak, and with recent transmission of SARS-CoV from palm civets to humans (Guan et al, 2003; Zhong, 2004; Song et al, 2005).
Differences among these S proteins permitted identification of key changes necessary for adaptation to the human receptor. In particular, changes at S-protein residues 479 and 487 appear to be critical for high-affinity association with human ACE2. The alteration at 479 to a small, uncharged residue is a consistent property of all described SARS-CoV obtained from humans, whereas most civet-derived viruses retain a basic residue at this position (Guan et al, 2003; Marra et al, 2003; Rota et al, 2003; He et al, 2004; Zhang et al, 2004; Song et al, 2005). Our data indicate that residue 479 interacts with residues along a ridge formed by ACE2 α-helix 1, and in particular with lysine 31, which is present in human but not palm-civet ACE2. Alteration of S-protein residue 479 to the asparagine found in virus isolated from humans appears to accommodate this human ACE2 lysine.
Differences at S-protein residue 487 are also of interest. A threonine at position 487 is absolutely conserved in all of the more than 100 S proteins isolated during the severe 2002–2003 outbreak. In contrast, the S proteins of viruses isolated during the 2003–2004 outbreak, and all 14 animal SARS-CoV isolated, had a serine at this position (Guan et al, 2003; He et al, 2004; Zhang et al, 2004; Song et al, 2005). A threonine at position 487 increased affinity of most RBDs assayed for both human and palm-civet ACE2, and all chimeras thereof, and substantially enhanced the efficiency with which palm-civet-derived S protein infected cells expressing human ACE2. These observations indicate that the additional methyl group of threonine 487 participates in the efficiency of infection of human and non-human cells.
S-protein alterations at residues 479 and 487 are important for high-affinity association with human ACE2, and for efficient infection of cells expressing this receptor. Knowledge of these residues may be useful in assessing the risk posed by any new SARS-CoV outbreak. Our data also show that, even with these and other changes outside the RBD, SARS-CoV is imperfectly adapted to its human receptor. In particular, introduction of residues 90–93 of civet ACE2 into the human receptor increased binding of, and infection mediated by, all S proteins assayed. This effect may be due to removal of a glycosylation site at position 90 to which no SARS-CoV has fully adapted. This observation raises the possibility that soluble human ACE2 lacking this glycosylation would more effectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication than wild-type human ACE2.
We have previously shown that replication of SARS-CoV in a murine cell line is limited by the low affinity of the S protein for murine ACE2 (Li et al, 2004). Moreover, the affinity of S protein for the receptors of rats, mice, and humans correlates with the ability of virus to replicate in these animals. The lower affinity of palm-civet-derived S protein for the palm-civet receptor is consistent with this pattern in that no overt disease was manifest in animals from which this virus was isolated (Guan et al, 2003), but disease was observed in palm civets challenged with isolates obtained during the 2002–2003 outbreak (Wu et al, 2005). Together, these observations suggest that the affinity of S protein for ACE2 is an important determinant in the overall rate of viral replication and in the severity of disease. If so, adaptations within the S protein that are critical for high-affinity association with human ACE2 may have contributed to the unusual severity of SARS.
Plasmid encoding a codon-optimized form of the SARS-CoV S protein of the TOR2 isolate (accession number AY274119) has been previously described (Li et al, 2003; Moore et al, 2004). Plasmids encoding the corresponding S proteins of the GD03T0013 isolate, isolated during the mild 2003–2004 outbreak (accession number AY525636; denoted GD herein), and the SZ3 isolate, isolated from palm civets (accession number AY304486), were generated de novo by recursive PCR. Plasmids encoding the S1 domain (residues 12–672) and the RBD (residues 318–510) of the TOR2 S protein, fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (S1-Ig and RBD-Ig, respectively), have been previously described (Li et al, 2003; Wong et al, 2004). Corresponding S1-Ig and RBD-Ig variants of the GD and SZ3 isolates and variant ACE2 molecules were generated by mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Invitrogen). Human, rat, and palm-civet ACE2 molecules were amplified from cDNA of corresponding tissue by PCR, and cloned into a vector encoding previously described amino- and carboxy-terminal tags (Li et al, 2004).
Association of S1-Ig or RBD-Ig with ACE2 variants was determined by flow cytometry and by immunoprecipitation. Flow cytometry using ACE2-expressing cells has been previously described (Li et al, 2003; Wong et al, 2004). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding ACE2 variants, or with vector alone. At 2 days post-transfection, cells were detached in PBS/5 mM EDTA and washed with PBS/0.5% BSA. S1-Ig or RBD-Ig, or variants thereof, or the anti-tag antibody 9E10, were added to 106 cells, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS/0.5% BSA, and then incubated for 30 min on ice with anti-human IgG FITC conjugate (Sigma). Cells were again washed with PBS/0.5% BSA, and analyzed.
Immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (Li et al, 2003; Wong et al, 2004). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid encoding ACE2 variants and radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine. After 2 days, transfected cells were harvested and lysed in PBS buffer containing 1% CHAPSO. Cell lysates were incubated with Protein A–Sepharose beads together with 2 μg S1-Ig or RBD-Ig variants, or with the antibodies 1D4, recognizing a carboxy-terminal C9 tag on ACE2, or 9E10, recognizing an amino-terminal myc tag. Protein A–Sepharose beads were washed three times in PBS/0.5% CHAPSO, and analyzed by SDS–PAGE. Immunoprecipitated ACE2 variants were quantified by phosphorimaging.
TOR2 RBD-Ig variants were also assayed by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 3000. A 200 nM portion of purified RBD-Ig of TOR2 variants was bound to an anti-human antibody (Sigma I-2136) immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip. Soluble human ACE2 in HBS-EP buffer (Biacore) was introduced at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at concentrations of 700, 200, 40, 8, 1.6, and 0 nM. Kinetic parameters were determined with BIA-EVALUATION software (Biacore).
MLV expressing GFP and pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S-protein variants has been previously described (Moore et al, 2004). Briefly, MLV virions were generated by cotransfecting plasmid encoding MLV gag and pol genes, the pQCXIX vector (BD Sciences) expressing GFP, and plasmid encoding S-protein variants. At 48 h post-transfection, cell supernatants were normalized for reverse transcriptase activity and incubated with HEK293T cells transfected with ACE2 variants. At 48 h postincubation, GFP fluorescence of infected cells was measured by flow cytometry. In some cases, cells were preincubated for 1 h with the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 or with NH4Cl before infection, and equivalent concentrations were maintained during infection.
Infection was also assayed with a lentivirus expressing a luciferase reporter gene and pseudotyped with S-protein variants, as previously described (Sui et al, 2005). Briefly, 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid encoding S-protein variants, a plasmid (pCMVΔR8.2) encoding HIV-1 Gag-Pol, and a plasmid (pHIV-Luc) encoding the firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. At 2 days post-transfection, viral supernatants were harvested and 3 ìl of S-protein-pseudotyped virus was used for infection of 6000 ACE2-expressing 293T cells in a 96-well plate. Infection efficiency was quantitated by measuring the luciferase activity in the target cells with an EG&G Berthold Microplate Luminometer LB 96V.
The enzymatic activity of ACE2 was assayed using a fluorogenic substrate, 7-methoxycoumarin-YVADAPK(2,4-dini trophenyl)-OH (R&D Systems). Cleavage of this peptide by ACE2 removes the 2,4-dinitrophenyl moiety that quenches the fluorescence of the 7-methoxycoumarin moiety. A 1 μg portion of a soluble form of ACE2 (Moore et al, 2004) was incubated in 100 mM Tris buffer with varying concentrations of the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (Dales et al, 2002). Fluorescence was monitored at 5 min intervals using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm.

25. Globalization and Health
I am pleased to introduce 'Globalization and Health', a peer reviewed, open access (free to the end user) journal. In this, the début editorial, I will briefly outline the purpose and scope of this journal highlighting our intention to publish a balanced mixture of opinion on the subject.
That the journal be 'Open Access' is entirely appropriate. Knowledge, at its best utility, is a 'public good' i.e. non-rival, non-excludable. While this journal will deal with the subject matter of creating 'global public goods for health', it will also by virtue of its very existence, contribute toward that process. Globalization and Health's 'Open Access' policy changes the way in which articles are published. First, all articles become freely and universally accessible online, and so an author's work can be read by anyone at no cost. Second, the authors hold copyright for their work and grant anyone the right to reproduce and disseminate the article, provided that it is correctly cited and no errors are introduced [1]. Third, a copy of the full text of each Open Access article is permanently archived in an online repository separate from the journal. Globalization and Health's articles are archived in PubMed Central [2], the US National Library of Medicine's full-text repository of life science literature, and also in repositories at the University of Potsdam [3] in Germany, at INIST [4] in France and in e-Depot [5], the National Library of the Netherlands' digital archive of all electronic publications. Importantly, the results of publicly funded research will be accessible to all taxpayers and not just those with access to a library with a subscription. As such, Open Access could help to increase public interest in, and support of, research. Note that this public accessibility may become a legal requirement in the USA if the proposed Public Access to Science Act is made law [6]. Added to this, a country's economy will not influence its scientists' ability to access articles because resource-poor countries (and institutions) will be able to read the same material as wealthier ones (although creating access to the internet is another matter [7]).
The rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold:
Firstly: Globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease. The determinants of health – be they a SARS virus or a predilection for fatty foods – have joined us in our global mobility. Driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies, the phenomenon of 'access' is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing.
Secondly: Understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings. Health is one such barometer. It is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve.
And lastly: In as much as globalization can have an effect on health, it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the AIDS pandemic.
A balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health (and health systems) are neither universally good nor bad, but rather context specific. The extent to which individual states are able to engage the process of globalization on their own terms differs widely from one country to the next. Child mortality, for example, changes quickly in response to subtle changes in purchasing power in impoverished communities. In affluent communities however, a small change in income has little effect on utility in either direction. As we consider the effects of globalization on wellbeing it becomes apparent that we need to consider both the long term scenarios for populations as a whole, and the immediate effects for the more vulnerable within those populations who are dependent on fragile local economies.
If the dialogue pertaining to globalization is to be directed or biased in any direction, then it must be this: that we consider the poor first.
The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.

26. Pseudoknots: RNA Structures with Diverse Functions
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus. Infection of humans by both HDV and hepatitis B virus is generally more severe than a hepatitis B virus infection alone [10]. HDV has a circular genome that is replicated by the host RNA polymerase II through a double-rolling-circle mechanism. This mechanism produces long strands of RNA that must be processed into unit lengths for viral replication. The processing of the viral RNA is achieved by the self-cleaving HDV ribozyme encoded in the RNA [11]. The HDV ribozyme folds into a double-pseudoknot conformation and self-cleaves, producing single-genome-length HDV RNAs. The HDV ribozyme is the fastest-known naturally occurring self-cleaving ribozyme, with a cleavage rate greater than one per second, and is active in vitro in the absence of any proteins [12]. The HDV ribozyme consists of five helical segments that form two coaxial stacks of two (stems P2 and P3) and three (stems P1, P1.1, and P4) helices each (Figure 2A) [3,13]. Two pseudoknots are formed, each with one helix from each coaxial stack (stems P1 and P2, and stems P3 and P1.1). These two pseudoknots stack on top of each other, forming a nested double-pseudoknot conformation [13].
The removal of introns from pre–messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is fundamentally important for eukaryotic life. Most introns are removed by a ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. A subset of introns are self-cleaving, catalyzing their own removal from pre-mRNA without the aid of proteins [14]. One such class of introns are the group I self-splicing introns, with the most well-studied example being from the ciliate Tetrahymena. The structure of this ribozyme is made up of three helical domains, with many tertiary contacts between the domains [15]. The only portion of the RNA that spans all three helical domains is a pseudoknot belt that wraps around the molecule, base-pairing with all three helices [15]. The pseudoknot establishes the catalytic core of the group I self-splicing introns.
Naturally occurring ribozymes appear to perform mainly hydrolysis and transesterification reactions [16]; however, in vitro selection has yielded RNAs capable of performing a wide variety of enzymatic reactions [17]. Recently the structure of an RNA capable of catalyzing carbon–carbon bond formation by the Diels-Alder reaction was solved (Figure 2B) [18]. The RNA adopts a λ-shaped fold of its three helices in which stems 2 and 3 stack coaxially, with stem 1 abutting the active site, forming a pocket precisely complementary to the reaction product. The 5′ end of the RNA bridges helical stems 3 and 1, generating a complex nested pseudoknot topology. Although conformationally distinct from the HDV ribozyme [3], it is worthwhile to note that they are two of the fastest-known ribozymes, and both utilize a nested pseudoknot architecture [18].
Chromosomes possess protective ends known as telomeres to protect themselves from degradation due to successive rounds of DNA synthesis. Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the maintenance of the telomere ends [19], is upregulated in most cancers [20] and might play a role in aging [21]. Human telomerase is made up of a 451-nucleotide RNA, a reverse transcriptase, and other proteins [22]. At the 5′ end of the RNA is a highly conserved pseudoknot, required for activity, which lies at the core of telomerase. The structure of the human telomerase pseudoknot reveals a classic H-type pseudoknot fold with a slight bend between the stems (Figure 2C) [5]. A triple-helix structure flanks the junction of the helices and extends into each stem. Mutations within the telomerase pseudoknot have been directly linked to the diseases autosomal dyskeratosis congenita [21] and aplastic anemia [23].
Not all pseudoknots with biological functions are catalytically active. In fact, one of the most common functions of pseudoknots is to induce ribosomes to slip into alternative reading frames, otherwise known as frameshifting. Ribosomes typically translate mRNA without shifting the translational reading frame [24]. However, a number of organisms have evolved mechanisms to cause site-specific or programmed frameshifting of the ribosome in either the +1 or −1 direction [25]. Programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting is typically found in viruses and is required for the replication and proliferation of all retroviruses. Therefore, the pseudoknot structures involved in frameshifting are attractive targets for the development of antiviral drugs. The frameshift event is induced by two RNA elements within the mRNA: (i) a heptanucleotide slippery sequence X XXY YYZ (spaced triplets represent preframeshift codons) and (ii) a downstream RNA structure, typically a pseudoknot [26]. The mechanism behind how these elements promote −1 frameshifting is not fully understood. The current model posits that the ribosome encounters the downstream pseudoknot while the slippery sequence is being decoded by the ribosome. The pseudoknot structure likely causes the ribosome to pause, which is necessary but not sufficient for frameshifting to occur [27]. While paused on the slippery sequence, the ribosome slips back one nucleotide and subsequently continues translation in the −1 reading frame.
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) frameshift-inducing pseudoknot was the first structure of a frameshift-inducing pseudoknot (Figure 2D) [6]. The MMTV pseudoknot forms a compact structure of two guanine/cytosine-rich A-form helices. The MMTV pseudoknot has a bend of approximately 60° between the two helices, caused by an unpaired adenine that intercalates between the helices and may act as a hinge. Subsequent structural and functional studies of several variants of the MMTV pseudoknot reveal that the intercalated nucleotide and the resulting bend between stems 1 and 2 are required for efficient frameshifting [28].
In beet western yellow virus, pea enation mosaic virus, and other luteoviruses, an RNA pseudoknot also stimulates a −1 frameshift between the P1 and P2 genes [29]. These structures, solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR, respectively, revealed compact H-type pseudoknots with extensive loop–stem interactions (Figure 2E) [7,9]. Like that of MMTV, frameshift-inducing pseudoknots in both the beet western yellow virus and pea enation mosaic virus have an unpaired nucleotide at the junction of the stems; however, this nucleotide is displaced from the helix, not intercalated as in MMTV.
The frameshift-inducing pseudoknot from simian retrovirus 1 contains a number of unique features (Figure 2F) [8]. Although predicted to resemble that of MMTV, with an unpaired adenine between the helices, the structure revealed the formation of a uracil–adenine pair at the junction, allowing the two stems to stack directly on top of each other (Figure 2F) [8]. The simian retrovirus 1 pseudoknot forms an extensive loop 2–stem 1 triplex, which contains a ribose zipper motif in addition to base–base and base–sugar interactions [8].
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome contains two large genes, ORF 1a and ORF 1b, separated by a programmed −1 frameshift element required for ORF 1b expression [30]. Recent work has suggested that the SARS-CoV frameshift-inducing pseudoknot may be unique because it contains a third stem–loop [31,32]. In this issue of PLoS Biology, bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and structural evidence is reported indicating that the SARS-CoV pseudoknot is indeed a three-stemmed RNA pseudoknot (see Figure 1D) [33]. Dinman and co-workers report the potential for the formation of this three-stemmed pseudoknot in all coronaviruses in the GenBank database. NMR experiments confirmed the proposed three-stemmed pseudoknot structure in SARS-CoV. Although the atomic-resolution structure has not yet been determined, this study identifies a new secondary structure capable of promoting frameshifting that is structurally distinct from previously described pseudoknots (see Figure 1D).
RNA pseudoknots have been identified in nearly every organism and comprise functional domains within ribozymes, self-splicing introns, ribonucleoprotein complexes, viral genomes, and many other biological systems. It is clear that the pseudoknot topology can result in many different, complex structures. The pseudoknot, therefore, represents an important piece of RNA architecture, as it provides a means for a single RNA strand to fold upon itself to produce a globular structure capable of performing important biological functions.

27. Three-dimensional structure of the bacteriophage P22 tail machine
Most double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages evolve a highly specialized tail that is crucial to infection and is composed of numerous copies of proteins (Brussow and Hendrix, 2002). These tailed phages form the order of Caudovirales and are classified into three families based on tail morphology: Myoviridae, which have a long contractile tail; Siphoviridae, which have a long but noncontractile tail; and Podoviridae, which have a short tail (Ackermann, 1998). Bacteriophage P22, one of the prototypes in Podoviridae, is characterized by a short tail structure incorporated into a unique five-fold vertex of the icosahedral phage capsid (Poteete, 1994). This tail structure is a molecular machine that consists of multiple protein components with a total mass over 2.8 million Daltons and integrates various biological functions that are critical to the assembly and infection of the phage (Table I). The assembly of the tail machine is initiated by incorporation of the portal protein into one vertex of the procapsid during procapsid assembly together with several copies of each of three minor proteins (Bazinet et al, 1988). The minor proteins and the portal complex are required for infectivity but not for procapsid assembly (Botstein et al, 1973). The portal forms a ring that provides a conduit for DNA entry during phage assembly and DNA exit during infection (Bazinet and King, 1985), as in many other dsDNA phages and some eukaryotic viruses such as herpesvirus (Newcomb et al, 2001; Sheaffer et al, 2001; Dittmer and Bogner, 2005). Upon completion of DNA packaging, proteins gp4, gp10 and gp26 are attached to the portal to form a slender substructure, which stabilizes the packaged DNA by preventing it from leaking out of the capsid (King et al, 1973; Lenk et al, 1975; Strauss and King, 1984). In the last step of phage assembly, tailspikes are attached. The tailspike protein, a homotrimer of 72 kDa subunits, is anchored by its N-terminal head-binding domain in a noncovalent but irreversible manner (Berget and Poteete, 1980; Maurides et al, 1990). The C-terminal receptor-binding domain of the tailspike recognizes and cleaves the O-antigenic repeating units of lipopolysaccharide on the cell surface of Salmonella bacteria (Iwashita and Kanegasaki, 1976). This is followed by the injection of the phage DNA through the tail into the host cytoplasm.
The structure and assembly of the capsid of P22 as well as many other bacterial and eukaryotic dsDNA viruses have been studied extensively (Stewart et al, 1991; Wikoff et al, 2000; Zhou et al, 2000; Conway et al, 2001; Grunewald et al, 2003; Heymann et al, 2003; Jiang et al, 2003; Rixon and Chiu, 2003; Abrescia et al, 2004; Fokine et al, 2004). However, the current knowledge about the detailed architecture of the tail in dsDNA bacteriophage has been scarce, and is largely limited to the case of T4, a bacteriophage of Myoviridae family that infects Escherichia coli. Large-scale rearrangement of protein subunits was observed by comparison of the structures of the noncontracted and contracted tails of T4 (Kostyuchenko et al, 2003; Leiman et al, 2004). The electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) structure of Bacillus phage SPP1 portal in complex with head completion proteins gp15 and gp16, through which the tail is connected to the head, revealed local conformational change of the portal upon binding of gp15 and the function of gp16 as a valve (Orlova et al, 2003). Here, we present the three-dimensional structures of the tail machine and a C-terminally truncated form of the portal protein of bacteriophage P22 determined by cryoEM and image reconstruction. Combining data of biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, cryoEM and genomics sources, we have located the five protein components in this elegant molecular machine. The structures indicate novel functions of component proteins that were not recognized previously, and provided insights into the biological functions of the tail machine as a whole.
The P22 tail machine was purified from the mature phage by disrupting the phage head. The C-terminally truncated portal protein was overexpressed in E. coli. CryoEM reconstructions were performed on the tail machine and the isolated portal assembly. The latter was fitted into the three-dimensional map of the tail machine to facilitate localization of components.
The electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated P22 tail machine showed excellent homogeneity (Figure 1A). The particle has six lobes surrounding a ring-like hub. The low density in the middle of the hub indicates the presence of a channel. There is a small piece of high density at the center or near the edge of the hub, which could be the axial projection of a rod-like substructure. This is more clearly visible in the class average of the images (Figure 1A). The particles have preferential orientation in the vitrified ice. That is, virtually all the particles are oriented in such a way that the central channel is perpendicular to the ice plane. To overcome the problem in three-dimensional reconstruction owing to the preferential orientation, we took series of micrographs by tilting the grids through various angles up to 60° (Figure 1B and C). An initial model was built manually by addition of six cylindrical density elements and a small spherical density to the reconstruction of the isolated truncated portal (see below). The final reconstruction was computed with 11 329 particles from tilted micrographs. The elongated needle-like density arising from the spherical one in the original map served as a validation for the reconstruction.
The preliminary crystallographic analysis of full-length P22 portal protein to 7 Å resolution was previously reported (Cingolani et al, 2002). Further X-ray structural studies have been hampered by difficulties in improvement of crystal quality, which is probably due to the high structural flexibility of the portal. We have conducted cryoEM and image reconstruction of the truncated portal assembly encompassing residues 1–602. The cryoEM structure shows a ring-like morphology shared by portals of phi29, SPP1, T3 and herpes simplex virus (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002; Orlova et al, 2003; Trus et al, 2004) (Figure 2A and B). The crown, wing and stalk domains are discernible (Figure 2B). The crown and wing domains are connected by thin density, implying plausible dynamics in terms of relative orientation/position between these two domains, which might be required for the regulatory role of the crown domain during DNA packaging and/or ejection (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002; Orlova et al, 2003). The diameter of the portal channel varies with the narrowest 35 Å at the bottom opening and 40 Å at the top opening. The maximal diameter of the channel is ∼70 Å below the crown domains, creating a hollow space inside the portal complex. The X-ray structure of phi29 portal shows a channel of 36 Å at the bottom opening, which widens up to ∼60 Å at the top opening. However, residues 231–244 that were not visible in the structure of phi29 portal presumably point inward from the channel wall, and could occupy a position similar to that of the P22 portal crown domain, which would limit the actual inner diameter of the channel. In contrast, the channel of the SPP1 portal has a relatively constant diameter as was shown in a cryoEM reconstruction (Orlova et al, 2003). Hence, assuming that a B-form DNA passes through this channel, two contact sites would be present in P22 portal involving the crown domain and the distal end of the stalk domain, respectively, whereas the DNA–portal interactions in SPP1 portal would be more evenly distributed over the whole channel. The truncated C-terminal 122 residues are most likely situated above the crown domain on the outer surface of the portal assembly, which is consistent with the fact that the C-terminal His tag is accessible to the Ni column during purification of the tail machine (see Materials and methods).
In the P22 portal cryoEM map, the molecular boundary in the stalk domain is readily recognizable (Figure 2). The stalk domain has an elongated shape, and the long axis is skewed by ∼25° with respect to the 12-fold rotational axis. The X-ray structure of the phi29 portal was docked into the cryoEM map of the P22 portal (Figure 2C) (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002). The elongated density of the stalk domain in the P22 portal fits well with the coordinates of the characteristic long α helices (residues 130–155 and 206–225) in phi29 portal (Guasch et al, 2002). This similarity in stalk domain orientation implies a common mechanical role in the DNA packaging molecular motor (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002; Serwer, 2003). On the other hand, differences in the size and local structure of the other two domains correspond to more diverse regulatory functions, such as sensing and signaling during DNA packaging and ejection, and interactions with other proteins in the phage (Casjens et al, 1992; Molineux, 2001; Isidro et al, 2004).
The reconstruction of the tail machine reveals a structure with a height of 416 Å and a maximal diameter of 260 Å, which is made up of three major parts: a central tube, six appendages and a needle (Figures 3 and 4A). The atomic structures of the C-terminal receptor-binding domain and the N-terminal head-binding domain of the tailspike gp9 were determined at high resolution (Steinbacher et al, 1996, 1997), whereas X-ray structures of other protein components are lacking. Combination with genetic and biochemical data as well as the cryoEM reconstruction of the isolated P22 portal has allowed us to localize the five-component proteins in the three-dimensional map of the tail machine. The upper major part of the tail machine is a tube with a channel of 43 Å diameter in the middle (Figures 3 and 4A), which is presumably the conduit for viral DNA entry during packaging and exit during infection. The diameter of the channel varies from 113 Å at the top opening, to the narrowest 43 Å, and 52 Å at the distal end (Figure 4A). The outer diameter of the tube ranges from 80 Å for the bottom end to 164 Å for the top wider end. The upper portion of this tube is assigned as the portal and the lower portion as gp4 and gp10. Attached to the lower half of the tube are six elongated appendages, each of which is a trimer of the tailspike protein gp9. The bottom opening of the tube is plugged by a 218 Å long needle-like density, which is coaxial with the tube. This needle has been interpreted as gp26.
The tailspike polypeptide consists of two domains, a C-terminal domain that binds the lipopolysaccharide receptor and an N-terminal head-binding domain that is responsible for attachment to the phage, with the domain boundary at residues 100–120. The structures of both domains were solved by X-ray crystallography independently, which provided atomic models for residues 5–108 and 113–666 (Steinbacher et al, 1996; Steinbacher et al, 1997). However, the connection between the two domains has not been established owing to lack of structural information for the residues in the domain boundary. The six appendages in the cryoEM map of the tail machine clearly correlate with the two atomic models. The trimeric organization of each tailspike is evident both in the cryoEM micrograph (Figure 1A) and in a cross-section contour of the cryoEM map (Figure 4B). The X-ray structure of the receptor-binding domain of the tailspike protein was unambiguously docked into the appendage in a global search over the whole cryoEM map with the program colores (Wriggers et al, 1999) (Figure 4). The domain is oriented in such a way that one monomer points outward away from the global six-fold axis while the other two monomers face to the tail tube.
The atomic model of the trimeric head-binding domains was then manually fit into the rest of the appendage density on the top. The orientation of the head-binding domain trimer about its internal three-fold axis is somewhat arbitrary. However, the intratrimeric rotational three-fold axes of the head-binding domains and of the receptor-binding domains intersect at 20°. In addition, the three-fold axis of the head-binding domains points outward by 18° away from the global six-fold axis of the tail machine, and that of the receptor-binding domains inclines by 8° when viewed from tailspike toward the global six-fold axis. This misorientation between the two domains is allowed by the flexible linkage near residues 100–120 between the two domains (Steinbacher et al, 1997). It is not clear what force holds these two domains into the current conformation. Nevertheless, the current structure may represent a closed conformation. Upon host cell attachment, the receptor-binding domains bind to the lipopolysaccharide and may spread out like a blooming flower so that the bottom opening of the channel in the tail tube is closer, and therefore has easier access, to the host cell membrane.
The interface between the tailspike and the tail tube appears to encompass more area than the lateral surface of the whole head-binding domain of one tailspike subunit (Figure 4). This suggests that binding of tailspike on the tail tube involves the interface formed by two head-binding domains. In fact, an Asp100Asn mutation that disrupted the interface between head-binding domains decreased the affinity of the tailspike to the tail tube to 1% of the wild-type tailspike (Schwarz and Berget, 1989; Steinbacher et al, 1997). This large contact area and plausible large conformational change in the local structure of the head-binding domain polypeptides could explain the noncovalent but irreversible binding of the tailspike (Berget and Poteete, 1980; Maurides et al, 1990). We propose that the tailspike-binding site on the tail tube is located on the interface of the two tail tube proteins gp4 and gp10, as gp10 is required for attachment of the tailspike (Strauss and King, 1984), and the mass of gp4 and gp10 implies that the molecular boundary between them crosses the tailspike-binding site (see below).
The upper end of the tail tube shows a wider opening. Inspection of the morphology indicates that it accounts for the wing domain in the portal. Indeed, the cryoEM structure of the C-terminally truncated portal fits well with the upper part of the tail tube in the map of the tail machine (Figure 4). Nevertheless, the crown domain was not visible in the tail machine reconstruction, putatively resulting from the dynamic nature of this domain upon tail assembly.
The 12-fold symmetry of the wing domains of the portal is clearly visible in the tail machine map, although only six-fold symmetry was imposed during reconstruction (Figures 3 and 4C).
Early data on the assembly pathway of P22 suggested that, after DNA packaging and terminase release, the portal provides docking sites for gp4, and subsequently gp10 is attached (Strauss and King, 1984). Binding of gp10 requires binding of gp4, whereas gp4 is able to bind to the phage head without the presence of gp10 (Strauss and King, 1984). Therefore, the middle and the lower parts of the tail tube are accounted for by gp4 and gp10, respectively (Figure 4). Genomics data of P22-like phages revealed as high as 93% amino-acid sequence identity for gp10 (Casjens et al, 2004). Interestingly, high identity was detected for the N-terminal 48, 77 and 115 residues of gp4, gp26 and gp9, respectively, with their putative homologs, whereas the other portions of these proteins show considerably lower identity (Casjens et al, 2004). These data support the role of gp10 as a molecular junction in the tail assembly of P22-like phages. That is, gp10 serves as a common platform for binding of the N-terminal domains from gp4, gp26 and tailspike. The variable C-terminal domain of gp4, gp26 and tailspike either binds to the portal or performs respective biological functions that are related to phage/host specificity.
We have extracted the putative density for gp4 and gp10 by computationally subtracting the density for the tailspike, the needle and the portal. The resultant density predicts a molecular mass of 521 kDa, when the map is contoured at a level that is used for the whole tail machine map to yield 100% mass. This value is in good agreement with the mass of a gp10 hexamer and a gp4 12-mer, which is 531 kDa. Therefore, we infer that gp4 and gp10 are present in the tail assembly as a 12-mer and hexamer, respectively. In fact, the cryoEM map clearly shows six protrusions at the bottom end of the tail tube, and the density distribution in horizontal sections shows six peaks (Figures 3, 4B and D). In contrast, gp4 has more contiguous density. In phage T4, gp13, gp14, gp15 and gp3 form a neck region that connects the tail to the portal, and both gp13 and gp14 are dodecameric, whereas gp15 and gp3 appears to be hexameric (Leiman et al, 2004). The cryoEM structure of SPP1 connector with the head completion proteins gp15 and gp16 showed that gp15 and gp16 are both dodecameric (Orlova et al, 2003). Gp4 appears as a nut that fits around a bolt formed by the distal end of the portal (Figures 4A and 6), in sharp contrast to the SPP1 connector where the portal slightly encompasses gp15 (Orlova et al, 2003). Taking into consideration the molecular mass of the two proteins (Table I), a putative line of the boundary between gp4 and gp10 can be drawn, and this line turns out to be within the tailspike-binding site (Figure 4). Thus, the interface between gp4 and gp10 provides the binding site for the tailspike. This ensures that gp4 and gp10 together form only six sites for tailspike binding, although gp4 is a 12-mer, as it would create irregular binding patterns other than the normal six-fold binding of tailspike if 12 binding sites were present. This is consistent with the highly homogeneous hexavalent binding of the tailspike in the tail assembly in the experimental preparation.
The lower end of the channel is plugged by a needle with a length of 214 Å and a diameter of about 38 Å (Figures 3 and 4). We assigned this needle density to gp26 based on several lines of evidence. First, gp26 is required for preventing packaged DNA from leaking out of the capsid, and was proposed to be the last protein in the sequential assembly of the tail (Israel, 1977; Strauss and King, 1984). Lack or mutation of gp4 and gp10 blocks attachment of gp26 (Strauss and King, 1984). Second, sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction show two long helices characterized by multiple heptad repeats, which implies that this protein folds as a trimeric coiled coil (Figure 5). This structural motif was observed in the C-terminal 119 residues of fibritin that forms the whiskers of phage T4 (Tao et al, 1997), and type I membrane fusion proteins in many enveloped viruses such as hemagglutinin of influenza virus (Gamblin et al, 2004; Stevens et al, 2004) and spike proteins in coronavirus (Xu et al, 2004). The length of the predicted long helix composed of ∼100 residues would be 150 Å, which fits well with the overall length of the needle taking into consideration that the remaining residues form domain structures near the N- and C-termini. The trimerization of heterologously expressed and purified gp26 in solution was observed by sedimentation equilibrium analysis (Andrews et al, 2005). Third, genetic mosaicism studies suggested that gp10 serve as a common platform for binding of the N-terminal domains from gp4, gp26 and gp9 with homology among P22-like phages (see the previous section). We postulate that the N-terminal proximity of gp26 is involved in binding with gp10, and most likely forms a subdomain to interact with the bottom tip of gp10. The cryoEM map shows slender but clear density between the top of gp26 and the bottom tip of gp10, and this interaction holds gp26 in the present conformation (Figure 4D).
Early work on P22 indicated that gp26 was the last in the three accessory proteins to be attached to the tail (Strauss and King, 1984). The location of gp26 appears to support a long-standing thought that it acted as a plug to prevent the packaged DNA from leaking. In Bacillus bacteriophage SPP1, there is no counterpart of gp26 and the role of a plug is played by a portion of accessory protein gp16, which forms a seal near the distal end of the connector and blocks the channel (Orlova et al, 2003). Interestingly, the length of 214 Å places gp26 at the forefront when the phage interacts with the host cell. Considering the position of lipopolysaccharide on the cell surface where the tailspikes are bound, the bottom tip of the gp26 needle could be deeply inserted into the outer membrane, and reach the peptidoglycan and even the inner membrane. Given the rigid nature of the triple-helical coiled-coil motif, a natural thought is that gp26 could serve as a mechanism for perturbation of the host cell outer membrane, if not as a cell-puncturing device such as that in T4 (Kanamaru et al, 2002), which in turn allows DNA translocation across the cell membrane. The contact of gp26 with the host cell outer membrane and/or peptidoglycan may physically strip it off the gp10. Indeed, gp26 was among the ejection proteins that were released from the phage virion after host cell attachment (Israel, 1977). The release of gp26 may produce a signal to be transduced through gp10, gp4 and the portal into the interior of the phage head, and trigger the phage DNA translocation.
The molecular anatomy described above allows us to structurally understand the assembly of the P22 tail machine (Figure 6). Upon DNA packaging and terminase dissociation, gp4, gp10, gp26 and gp9 are attached in a precisely controlled order (Strauss and King, 1984). The structure of the tail machine illustrates an organization of multiple proteins governed through a variety of symmetry relationships (Figure 6). The ring-like dodecameric portal is located at one of the 12 five-fold vertices of the phage head, which is the first symmetry transition in the phage assembly. The accessory proteins gp4 and gp10 are attached to the portal to form a cylindrical tube with a central channel. This channel provides the conduit for phage DNA entry and exit. gp4 is dodecameric and gp10 is hexameric, as indicated in the cryoEM map. Thus, the second symmetry transition occurs between gp4 and gp10. The third symmetry transition takes place where the gp26 trimer is attached to the hexameric gp10. It forms a plug at the distal opening of the tail tube to prevent the packaged DNA from leaking. The six copies of trimeric tailspikes bind to the interface of gp4 and gp10 through its N-terminal domain. The C-terminal receptor-binding domain of the tailspike recognizes the O-antigenic repeat units of lipopolysaccharide on the surface of the host cell. The needle formed by gp26 most likely penetrates the outer membrane to reach the peptidoglycan layer, and then undergoes major conformational changes such as being dislodged from gp10 driven by the force created by tailspike-receptor binding. This opens the channel, and a signal is generated and relayed through gp10, gp4 and the portal into the internal head, and thus triggers a series molecular events leading to phage DNA translocation and/or delivery of minor phage proteins in some phages such as P22 and T7 (Israel, 1977; Strauss and King, 1984; Molineux, 2001).
Full-length P22 portal protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified as described previously (Cingolani et al, 2002). Concentrated portal rings displayed a characteristic pattern of degradation after ∼3 months storage at 4°C. Using a combination of mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing, we determined that full-length protein was cleaved around residue 602, which yields a large C-terminally truncated fragment ΔC(1–602) of ∼70 kDa. The portal protein DNA region encoding this fragment was amplified by PCR and ligated in a pET-21b vector. The ΔC(1–602) portal protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in LB media and expression of the recombinant protein induced by addition of 1 mM final concentration of IPTG. Expression was performed at 30°C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in the lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, plus various protease inhibitors) and disrupted by sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and the soluble fraction incubated with 5 ml of NTA-Ni-agarose beads, pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. After extensive washing with the wash buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 600 mM sodium chloride, 30 mM imidazole), bound P22 ΔC(1–602) portal protein was eluted with four bead-volumes of the elution buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 500 mM imidazole). The elution was then dialyzed against low-salt buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and concentrated to ∼50 mg/ml using a Millipore concentrator (molecular weight cutoff 50 kDa) to promote ring formation. Typically, a liter of E. coli yielded ∼50 mg of pure protein.
Lysis-defective (13−am H101) phage carrying the gene of a C-terminal 6xHis-tagged portal protein was generated as described previously (Moore and Prevelige, 2001). A booster lysate of viable phage was used to infect 12.0 l (37°C) of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium strain DB 7000 at an MOI of 10.0. The cells were harvested after 4 h and resuspended in a total volume of 240 ml of 10 mM MgCl2 and 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6, 20 ml/l) and immediately frozen at −80°C. Cells were lysed by 3 × freeze–thaw and addition of lysozyme to 0.1 mg/ml. The lysate was centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min (4°C) and the resultant supernatant centrifuged through a 20% (w/v) sucrose cushion at 195 000 g for 2 h at 4°C. The phage pellets were resuspended in a total volume of 5 ml 25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, by gentle shaking overnight at 4°C.
The resuspended phage was diluted 1:100 in a solution of 0.1 M EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.0 M urea and 50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0. This mixture was incubated in a 60°C water bath for 45 min to burst the phage heads and liberate the tail machines. This is a modification of the procedure originally described (Hartwieg et al, 1986). The suspension was cooled on ice, clarified by centrifugation (15 000 g, 30 min, 4°C) and dialyzed 3 × versus 1.0 l of 15 mM imidazole, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0. This was loaded onto a 5 ml Pharmacia Hi-Trap Ni·NTA® column equilibrated with dialysate. Tail machines were specifically eluted using an imidazole gradient. The collected fractions were simultaneously concentrated and buffer-exchanged (50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0) by centrifugation through a Pall-Filtron® 30 kDa cutoff membrane.
The sample was frozen-hydrated in vitrified ice on holey EM grids by a standard procedure (Adrian et al, 1984; van Heel et al, 2000). Briefly, 3–5 μl of sample was applied for 1 min onto a previously glow-discharged copper grid coated with a holey carbon film. The grid was blotted with Whatman #2 filter paper, plunged into a slush of liquid ethane and stored in liquid nitrogen. The grid was transferred with a Gatan 626 cryostage (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA) into a Phillips CM200FEG transmission electron microscope (Philips/FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) operated at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. Electron micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO156 films under low-dose conditions (5–20 electrons/Å2). Micrographs were digitized using a Zeiss SCAI scanner (Z/I Imaging Corporation, Madison, AL) with a step size of 7 μm. Particles were boxed with the program EMAN (Ludtke et al, 1999), and image reconstruction was carried out with the program SPIDER (Frank et al, 1996). The resolution was estimated with the Fourier shell correlation method (van Heel et al, 2000).
In the P22 portal reconstruction, particles were boxed into a 160 × 160 dimension with a pixel size of 1.84 Å. A total of 20 271 particles were used in the three-dimensional reconstruction. Image analysis by classification and averaging of images of negatively stained P22 portal showed 12-fold symmetry (data not shown), which was in agreement with the rotation function results from the X-ray crystallographic studies (Cingolani et al, 2002). Therefore, the 12-fold rotational symmetry was imposed during the reconstruction. The defoci of these micrographs ranged from 1.4 to 3.7 μm, and the contrast transfer function was corrected by phase flipping. The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated to be 8 Å, where the Fourier shell correlation between two independent reconstructions calculated from half data sets dropped to 0.5 (Figure 7A). The map revealed the crown, wing and stalk domains with a central channel. We were able to distinguish the subunit boundary at the stalk region, and the connection between the crown and wing domains was clearly defined in the map. The handedness of the map was determined assuming that the orientation of the stalk domain of the portal monomer is similar to that in the portal complex of bacteriophage phi29 whose atomic structures are available (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002).
As the P22 tail machine shows preferential orientation in ice, we took micrographs by tilting the grids by angles of 0, 20, 30, 40 and 60°. Inspection of the tilt series assisted manual building of an initial model by addition of six cylindrical density and a small spherical density to the portal reconstruction. In this initial model, one end of the cylindrical density was in close proximity to the lower part of the wing domain of the portal and the other end was slightly pointed outward so that the long axes of the cylinders and the portal channel form an angle of 15°. The small spherical density was placed next to the bottom opening of the portal. An initial data set of 3087 particles was used to calculate a preliminary reconstruction, which gave rise to an elongated needle-like density for the originally spherical one and therefore served as a validation for the reconstruction. A total of 17 517 particles were boxed from tilted micrographs into a 160 × 160 dimension with a pixel size of 4.2 Å. A reconstruction was calculated and refined using all the data and imposing C6 symmetry. In order to avoid possible inaccuracy in the length of the gp26 needle arising from saturated density in top or bottom views, the particles from untilted micrographs were excluded from the reconstruction. The gp26 needle in the reconstruction computed from all data was removed. With such an initial model and 11 329 particles from tilted micrographs, a new reconstruction was calculated and refined. The contrast transfer functions were not corrected. The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated to be 23 Å, where the Fourier shell correlation for two independent reconstructions calculated from half data sets started to drop to 0.5 (Figure 7B) (van Heel et al, 2000). The map has been deposited with EMDB database at the European Bioinformatics Institute with an accession code of EMD-1119.

28. Integration of the Gene Ontology into an object-oriented architecture
Complexity combined with an imprecise terminology has hindered the understanding of biology. A formal and structured vocabulary is now being developed to address this imprecise biology terminology. This vocabulary or Gene Ontology (GO) is being developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) [1] to standardize the descriptions of gene products. Ontologies define the basic terms and relations comprising the vocabulary of a topic area, as well as the rules for combining terms and relations to define extensions to the vocabulary [2]. Despite these efforts, the mechanism of representing these terms lacks a unifying architecture that can be applied to the annotation of a gene product. However, computer science has developed a well-defined process and methodology for the development of software models. Adapting this process and methodology can orchestrate the assembly of biological models with integrated gene ontologies. In doing so, a standardized terminology and object-oriented model is created that can facilitate communication between biologists and computer scientists.
The Gene Ontology project is a collaborative effort that addresses the need for a controlled vocabulary that provides a consistent description of gene products in different databases [1]. The GO collaborators are developing three structured, controlled vocabularies that describe gene products, which have been classified into molecular function, biological process, and cellular component domains. GO terms are organized in structures called directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which differ from hierarchies in that a 'child' (more specialized term) can have many 'parents' (less specialized terms). As part of these graphs, each component is given a GOid (unique identifier), and is associated with a GO definition. Collectively, these agreed upon terms are being developed to help explain various aspects of biology. When applied to a gene, that gene is annotated with a concise description of its molecular function, cellular location and associated biological processes. However, the GOC never intended to represent gene products or correlate ontological terms with these gene products [1]. To address this need, a Gene Ontology Annotation database [3] has been created to associate the GO terms with their gene product counterparts. With sustained effort, the descriptions of these gene products will ultimately be established. Still, much of the current bioinformatics work regarding GO has focused on constructing databases [4-7], applying it to other research areas [8-22], and building tools to mine the GO database. (For a description of some of these tools see [23].)
In addition, there has been an ongoing discussion regarding the depth of information obtained from the Gene Ontology [24]. It has been noted that there remains a need for a unifying architecture that integrates all three GO domains as part of a gene product's annotation. Furthermore, to enhance the Gene Ontology and facilitate its use as a cross-disciplinary tool, several additional issues need to be addressed. First, relationships between the biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components are not readily apparent [25-28]. Second, GO terms lack details. For instance, when one looks at molecular function there is no indication of what is inputted or outputted. Finally, existing tools such as GO-DEV [29] only contain software used for tool development and information retrieval, not software modeled directly after the three domains of the Gene Ontology. However, these issues can be resolved by integrating the Gene Ontology into an object-oriented system.
On a conceptual level, the Gene Ontology has features that support an object-oriented architecture. Consequently, the Gene Ontology can be applied and mapped to the fundamental concepts that form the object-oriented paradigm (i.e. class, object, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and encapsulation) (Table 1). Furthermore, in an object-oriented sense, biological process terms are equivalent to high-level concepts. However, GO biological process terms do not contain descriptive information about the dynamics or static interactions defined by the terms. By translating a biological process into an object-oriented model the dynamic and static events occurring within a process can be represented. Building a static and dynamic model of a biological process requires defining the components of the process as well as the functions and attributes contained within these components. These components are biological entities (bioentities) that may include individual gene products, whose processes, functions and cellular components are captured in the Gene Ontology, or other higher-level entities such as gene product complexes.
The functions of gene products are the jobs or abilities that it has. In the GO terminology these are described in the molecular function domain. These are analogous to the operations that an object can perform in an object-oriented paradigm. Attributes, which define key properties of a component that when changed may alter the function of that component, may be defined by the cellular component and molecular function sections. For example, the cellular component domain can specify the place in a cell where a gene product is located. When there are multiple cellular components associated with a gene product, however, there is currently no mechanism to designate which cellular component represents the appropriate location.
The unified modeling language has been used to capture various aspects of biology [30-32]. These examples highlight the utility of the unified modeling language as a tool for biological data integration, and indicate that it can be applied to construct large, complex biological models. Therefore, to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the Gene Ontology into an object-oriented model we have created unified modeling language (UML) representations of a GO biological process, "transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor complex assembly" (GO:0007181).
The TGF-beta receptor pathway is involved in numerous cellular events including apoptosis, tumor development, differentiation, and development. These processes stem from the binding of TGF-beta to its cellular receptors. Briefly, dimerized TGF-beta 1 binds to TGF-beta receptor II (TβRII) and then TGF-beta receptor I (TβRI) complexes [33], causing their tetramerization (two type II receptors and two type I receptors) [34-36]. Constitutively activated type II receptor phosphorylates and activates type I receptor. Type I receptor propagates the signal by phosphorylating Smad 2, which is presented by the Smad Anchor for Receptor Activation (SARA) [37]. Phosphorylation of Smad destabilizes the Smad interaction with SARA, releasing it [38]. On TGF-beta stimulation, Smad 2 forms heterotrimeric complexes with Smad 4 and accumulates in the nucleus, binds DNA and remains for several hours [39-42]. Dephosphorylation allows Smad 2 to dissociate from Smad 4 and to be exported to the cytoplasm [43,44]. If the receptors are no longer active, then the Smads accumulate over time in the cytoplasm [44]. Alternatively, activated Smad 2 is ubiquitinated in the nucleus and undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation [45].
To create a unified model using the Gene Ontology we have taken the biological process term, "transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor complex assembly" (GO:0007181), and used object-oriented models to define its dynamic and static architecture. We also show that one can augment the biological process domain terms by using the ontological terms and gene products associated with this process, and integrating them into an object-oriented model. Furthermore, we show that the molecular function, and cellular component domains can serve as a basis for the generation of object functions and attributes to create a standardized, comprehensive, and integrated model encompassing all the Gene Ontology domains.
The current DAG structure in which the Gene Ontology is represented is not readily amenable to transformation into software code. However, the architecture of directed acyclic graphs mimics that of an object-oriented class diagram. GO terms are presented in a parent-child hierarchy connected by 'is a' (generalizations) and 'part of' (composition) relationships. Read from top to bottom, the GO terms proceed from more specific to less specific. Directed acyclic graphs also allow the properties of multiple parent nodes to be inherited by child nodes, a form of multiple inheritance in object-oriented modeling. In figure 1A, cellular components related to the TGF-beta receptor complex are shown. One can create a UML diagram to mimic these relationships as shown in figure 1B. Since not all cellular components involved in the TGF-beta receptor complex assembly process are present in the current Gene Ontology, additional gene products based on literature searches were added to the object-oriented diagram (Figure 1B, shaded boxes). Relationships are captured as an object-oriented system through containment, composition and inheritance. Cellular components were decomposed into objects and connected via generalizations, which illustrate inheritance. Because these terms inherit all the attributes of their parents, only GO terms at the terminal nodes need be characterized in an object-oriented model. Relationships described as 'part of' were also extrapolated into object-oriented terms as composition.
The functions of gene products were also decomposed into object functions. The creation of object functions involved the transition from gene product functions to standardized GO molecular functions, and then to standardized, fully parameterized object functions. By applying formal ontological terms from the molecular function domain to gene products, object functions can be created with a consistent vocabulary. In table 2 we show the relationships between the function of a gene product defined in our model, and the GO molecular function term most closely corresponding to that cellular function. Here, we first compared ontology terms from the molecular function domain to those ascribed to individual gene products. Due to the incompleteness of the Gene Ontology, some gene product functions were extrapolated from the current literature, and then comparable GO molecular function terms were assigned to the gene products. Next, these molecular function terms were converted to object functions through reverse engineering. We identified the parameters that would normally be input into and output from a cellular reaction. In this way we defined the input and output parameters necessary for an object function. The object function itself was given the GOid that corresponds with its closest matching molecular function as defined by the GOid's definition. Together, object functions were created that are fully parameterized with inputs and outputs and that contain a standardized GO notation.
We conclude that it is feasible to create standardized functions for objects based on the current literature and an approved ontology. Together, ontological terms can be integrated into an object-oriented model paralleling the relationships, capturing the inherited aspects of the GO terminology, and providing a compact architecture while maintaining a standardized notation.
The GO biological process term, TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181), contains both static and dynamic features. The events of the TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181) process include TGF-beta binding (GO:0050431) to its receptors and SMAD binding (GO:0046332) and activation (GO:0042301). To capture the dynamic nature of these actions as an object-oriented software system, sequence diagrams were created. The events leading to Smad 2 activation are reflected chronologically in a high-level sequence diagram in Figure 2. The creation of the sequence diagram first entails identifying gene products and their functions by literature searches. Simple or complex bioentities are modeled as objects, which are represented by rectangles with vertical lifelines. Ontology terms taken from the molecular function domain that best corresponded to these functions were incorporated as object functions, which represent the functions of these gene products. These functions are implemented by the methods contained within the objects. Furthermore, these methods allow an object to communicate and interact with other objects, thus capturing cellular activities. To capture interactions between objects, one object can call a method of another object by connecting object lifelines in the sequence diagram (Figure 2). This invocation of a function of one object by another is described as one object sending a message to another object. Alternatively, a message may be passed from an object to itself as in the case of self-checks or autoactivation signals. In this way, real world processes may be captured using an object-oriented approach. For instance, to capture the formation of the TGF-beta and TGF-beta RII complex a GOid that closely corresponds to this ability is chosen as the method name. In this way the method can be cross-referenced to a GO term. Specifically, the method 'GO:0046982 (in Dimerized_TGF-beta, in Dimerized_RII)' references via the GOid, GO:0046982, "protein heterodimerization activity", and shows that a homodimer of TGF-beta and a homodimer of TGF-beta RII are needed to form the complex. Here, each dimer is thought of as a single entity, so the combination of these two entities is best represented as heterodimerization. A value of TGF-beta-TβRII_Complex is returned upon completion of the method as indicated by the return arrow. In contrast, the function call "GO:0042803 (in: SMAD2, in SMAD2)," references a self-call. The GOid can be cross-referenced to "protein homodimerization activity", which requires two SMAD2 components to generate the SMAD2 homodimer, but the message is passed only within the SMAD2 object. Furthermore, a message need not accept any parameters, as in the "translate()" function, which only returns a Boolean value indicating whether the action has occurred. Additional events such as TGF-beta RI activation, and Smad homodimerization, binding and activation are also reflected in figure 2. Together, this diagram demonstrates that the sequence of events occurring in the biological process, TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181), can be represented using the Gene Ontology, and can be integrated as part of the dynamics of an object-oriented software system.
Biological processes are created from a series of complex events. While there may be one main event scenario that most frequently leads to a specific outcome often, alternative scenarios that lead to a process conclusion exist. This is exemplified by the sequence of events found in the TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181). For instance, TGF-beta may initially bind to TGF-beta RII or TGF-beta RIII. To capture these alternative events as part of the dynamic architecture, an activity diagram was created to reflect the initial stages of TGF-beta signaling (Figure 3). Unlike the sequence diagram, which captures main scenario events, the action sequence or flow of the activity diagram can portray alternative outcomes. Taking the example above, if TGF-beta binds to the type III receptor then an alternative flow of events occurs for a time that then returns to the main flow of events. Other possible divergences that were modeled included whether to internalize the TGF-beta receptors via clathrin-dependent or lipid raft-dependent mechanisms. These pathways lead to either complex degradation or signal promotion. Because complex degradation is not specified in our use case, for simplicity, this event is routed to the final state. However, the main success scenario, signal promotion, continues until SMAD2 is released and TGF-beta complex assembly is finished. Together, the dynamic events occurring during the biological process, TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181) are captured.
The major components of a biological system are bioentities with functions and interactions. Likewise, the center of an object-oriented software system is objects. Complex bioentities formed from multiple gene products along with their relationships, are contained within the biological system encompassing the biological process term, TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181). To represent the components that execute the process, we captured these components as bioentities with functions, and their interactions. The events of the TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181) process include TGF-beta binding (GO:0050431) to its receptors, and SMAD binding (GO:0046332) and activation (GO:0042301). To capture this static architecture, class diagrams were generated that model the bioentities, operations, and interrelationships that occur between TGF-beta, its receptors, and Smad 2. Similarly to figure 1, figure 4 captures the major components of the initial phases of TGF-beta signaling as objects with their associations, using an object-oriented representation. However, unlike figure 1, this object-oriented representation of the components of the main receptor complex is enhanced by the addition of attributes and functions. These objects were given attributes that describe important characteristics that if changed, might alter the function of a component. The functions of the objects, which parallel gene product functions, were generated from the sequence diagrams and were represented using Gene Ontology terms. These functions or operations are a declaration of the methods that an object may use. Together, the models generated using the described object-oriented methodology yield a software system representation of a biological process, TGF-beta receptor complex assembly, capturing both static and dynamic relationships annotated with Gene Ontology terms.
In addition, the UML notation provides a mechanism to specify inheritance that may be used to indicate an object that is the foundation for other objects. For instance, a TGF-beta receptor object might be a generalization of the TGF-beta receptor I object (data not shown). These specific objects inherit the properties of the receptor object. In addition, binary associations containing cardinalities may indicate the number of objects interacting with another. For instance, TGF-beta can interact with one to many receptors, while a receptor can only interact with one TGF-beta at a time (Fig. 4). Cellular compartments where these gene products can be found are also shown. Here, guard conditions are added to distinguish conditions under which each gene product might be found in a particular cellular compartment. In this way, a spatial representation of the TGF-beta receptor complex components is also achieved. These class diagrams demonstrate that the static structure of a biological system can be represented as an object-oriented model with integrated Gene Ontology terms. Collectively, the models generated using the described object-oriented methodology yield a software system representation of a biological system, capturing both static and dynamic relationships annotated with integrated Gene Ontology terms.
We have utilized the Gene Ontology to construct an object-oriented representation of the initial steps of TGF-beta signaling, and the gene products contained therein. In doing so, we have provided a standardized framework for the integration of Gene Ontology terms into gene product descriptions. By capturing all of the relevant GO terms in one model, the disjointed GO vocabulary is assembled into a cohesive structure. This cohesive structure encompasses the fundamental concepts of the object-oriented paradigm.
We proposed a solution to three unaddressed issues within the current Gene Ontology. First, while the Gene Ontology has helped to formalize the vocabulary that describes biological systems, it lacks a specific integration method. Currently, when applied to gene products, Gene Ontology terms are only categorically listed. Second, the Gene Ontology domains, biological process, molecular function and cellular component lack coherence. In particular, no association exists between domains. Finally, the current Gene Ontology defines GO terms, but gives no indication of what is necessary to accomplish a particular function, or process. To resolve these problems we defined an object-oriented methodology and architecture that provides a unifying framework to integrate all Gene Ontology domains.
The central dogma of the object-oriented paradigm revolves around several key aspects. Specifically, an object-oriented framework should accommodate the class, object, inheritance, composition, encapsulation and polymorphism concepts. As shown in table 1, gene products and other bioentities can be decomposed into objects, which are created based on template classes. These objects utilize inheritance to acquire the attributes and properties of more general objects. Complex classes can also be disassembled into subclasses using composition. Encapsulation allows the simplification of the model without sacrificing functionality. For instance, we do not need to know specific details regarding how a gene product is translated, just that a process that is encapsulated by the function 'translate()' can create a protein. However, if we wished to delve deeper into the mechanics of the translation process the layered architecture of the object-oriented system would allow us to do so. It is also worth noting that the modular nature of the object-oriented system closely resembles the recently discovered modular structure of biological networks [46-48]. This resemblance further indicates that biological systems can be easily modeled as object-oriented systems. Finally, polymorphism allows one to describe shared functions among different gene products. In this way, a function that may be shared broadly with other gene products can be uniquely specified for a particular gene product.
By applying object-oriented methodologies and concepts the various domains of the Gene Ontology can be coordinated into one model. Currently, the mechanisms in the biological process domain are veiled. There is no indication as to what gene products form the biological process, or what molecular functions are necessary to accomplish the process. Furthermore, the outcome of a specific process is not obvious. As in our example, a process such as TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181) does not give any indication of the components, dynamics or outcomes that occur during this process. However, by incorporating GO terms as attributes and functions we can discern relationships between the three domains. Likewise, the cellular components domain does not provide temporal or spatial clues when applied to gene products. For instance, GO terms 'extracellular' and 'intracellular' may both be associated with a particular gene product. However, the distinction between when a gene product is extracellular and when it is intracellular is not apparent. By applying object-oriented principles we can set extracellular and intracellular to Boolean values, and we can specify which location is the current (true) location of a gene product.
In addition, by using object-oriented principles a GO molecular function term can be augmented with parameters and outcomes. For example, the function "GO:0046982: protein heterodimerization activity" has different input and output parameters depending on the particular protein that contains the function. This type of polymorphic behavior, where one function can be performed in multiple ways is not supported by the Gene Ontology. For example, protein A may heterodimerize with protein B, whereas protein C heterodimerizes with protein D. From the Gene Ontology it is not readily apparent as to what is being inputted into the dimerization function. However, by applying an object-oriented architecture to function "GO:0046982: protein heterodimerization activity" we get "GO:0046982 (in: Protein A, in: Protein B): Protein AB". This format is an improvement to the unparameterized GO term in that the function can be cross-referenced to protein heterodimerization activity via its GO term, and we also see that for protein A to heterodimerize we need both protein A and protein B. In addition, we now observe that a new entity called protein AB is created from this function. By capturing the above details in an object-oriented model the GO term becomes far more useful for both biologists and computer scientists. Using an object-oriented approach the Gene Ontology domains are integrated into one cohesive model.
Integration of the Gene Ontology terms into an object-oriented representation offers several additional benefits. The object-oriented model provides additional levels of detail not found in the Gene Ontology. One of the strengths of object-oriented technology is the ability to capture the dynamics of a system. For example, sequence diagrams can chronologically order events in a biological process. Activity diagrams afford one the opportunity to envision different scenarios that might be occurring in a process. This additional level of detail significantly increases the depth of information that can be applied to the description of a biological process. State-transition diagrams also contribute to the realization of the full dynamics of a process by allowing the visualization of gene product states within a process. Furthermore, UML models can be translated into code, facilitating the creation of simulations.
The standardization of biological system modeling and integration is growing rapidly. A widely accepted example of the drive toward standardization is the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) [49], which has been adopted by more than 70 software tools [50]. The Gene Ontology is another example. However, each of the technologies, the Gene Ontology, the object-oriented approach, and SBML, has strengths and weaknesses. The Gene Ontology provides a standardized vocabulary but contains disconnected domains with no details regarding terms. SBML was developed to communicate biological models, with an emphasis on mathematical modeling of biological systems, but does not specify how to construct these models. Object-oriented technologies, on the other hand, provide a well-defined process for model creation and visualization, but have not been standardized for biology. However, the Gene Ontology, object-oriented paradigm, and SBML can form a new synergism when jointly applied to a common biological system model. These technologies are steps toward a unified approach to biological information integration, and studying biological phenomena at the systems level. Together, this unified approach will make biological system integration and analysis consistent, manageable and controllable, which is essential in handling complex systems, as demonstrated by decades of software industry experience.
While the described object-oriented approach can significantly enhance the annotation of gene products using the Gene Ontology, several challenges will need to be addressed. Specifically, object-orientation was not specifically designed for use in biological systems. Therefore, its use in capturing biological systems is not well defined. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology is still expanding and undergoing revisions. Consequently, in the near future it will still be necessary to do literature searches to define all the gene ontologies associated with a gene product. However, automated extraction of information for UML model generation and software implementation for simulations is under development, but is beyond the scope of this paper.
Future systems may also be implemented as software libraries in object-oriented programming languages (C++ and Java) for computer scientists to construct software for various applications and can be distributed as part of the GO-DEV toolkit for Gene Ontology development [29]. In addition, reformatting gene products with Gene Ontology terms will require the cooperation of multiple groups of biologists and computer scientists. However, we must take into consideration that a primary issue with this approach is the lack of people with cross-disciplinary skills able to comprehend both the biology and the computer science. Nonetheless, our own experience has shown that with supervision one biologist without a formal computer science background can learn to model a biological system using UML in a matter of months. Furthermore, automation of some of the annotation process will significantly reduce the human effort, but not eliminate the need for human annotators. Additional standards for automation will also need to be developed to thoroughly specify the process of object-oriented biological system integration. Despite these challenges the ultimate goal of creating a library of UML objects or modules integrated with Gene Ontology attributes and functions is worthwhile. Through this endeavor, biological processes could be assembled from these libraries for the development of simulation tools that will increase the productivity of biologists through increased insight into disease pathways and mechanisms.
Here, we have demonstrated that Gene Ontology terms can be integrated into an object-oriented model. Furthermore, the object-oriented technology and methodologies used for this integration should improve the usability of these terms, and increase the depth of information that they contain. This work also serves as a framework for reverse-engineering biological gene products as objects in an object-oriented system. Together, this should facilitate additional collaborations between biologists and computer scientists.
To define the requirements and collect the information necessary for the generation of the models, two approaches were necessary. First, annotations of the TGF-beta signaling pathways were conducted during an extensive literature review. Second, gene ontologies and Uniprot entries were searched to assign Gene Ontology terms to gene products. The attributes and the interactions of the TGF-beta signaling components were captured using class-responsibility collaboration (CRC) cards as described previously [52] [see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4].
Based on the gathered information, best-case and alternative scenarios were developed within a so-called "use case" to describe the TGF-beta receptor complex assembly process [see Additional file 5]. The use case also serves to define the boundary and scope of the TGF-beta model. For demonstration purposes the boundary of the system was limited to the steps TGF-beta receptor complex assembly. Therefore, alternative events such as receptor ubiquitination and degradation, as well as the specifics of SMAD 2 mobility were not captured in the dynamic models (i.e. sequence diagram).
To provide an overview of the system and its interrelationships a conceptual based on the information defined in the requirement-gathering phase was generated [see Additional file 6]. This conceptual model integrated biological information, and represented TGF-beta and the cellular components involved in the complex assembly and their relationships in UML notation. By applying object-oriented analysis, the TGF-beta receptor complex assembly was decomposed into objects and component relationships were realized. However, information regarding component properties is hidden through encapsulation. This conceptual model defines the organization of the biological system and provides an overview of the components and their relationships.
The dynamics of the system can also be captured using state diagrams, which can be used to describe the transitions and different states that a cellular component can exist [see Additional file 7]. In addition, multiple concurrent states can be illustrated using this UML notation.
Sequence, activity and class diagrams have been used as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of generating an object-oriented representation of the biological process described by the GO term TGF-beta receptor complex assembly (GO:0007181), with Gene Ontology terms applied to generate these diagrams. Objects representing corresponding gene products are created, and their essential attributes are captured. Interactions among objects are also identified. For each interaction, a corresponding method is generated. This method is matched to a Gene Ontology term. The nature of the interaction determines the method parameters. The sequence of events is captured, and used to generate sequence diagrams. Scenarios are also generated for object interactions, and used to generate activity diagrams. The information captured in the sequence diagram and activity diagrams are used, along with the gene products attributes, to generate class diagrams.

29. Software for optimization of SNP and PCR-RFLP genotyping to discriminate many genomes with the fewest assays
Microbial forensics and epidemiology is important in tracking the source of a pathogen, whether the disease is a naturally occurring outbreak or part of a criminal investigation. Polymorphisms among isolates or strains provide information as to the origin, phylogenetic relationships, or transmission patterns of those isolates [1]. The 2001 anthrax attacks highlight the importance of rapid forensic identification of the source of an agent used in a bioterrorism event. Sequencing HIV fragments indicated that a Florida dentist probably infected at least six of his patients with HIV [2]. A series of court cases in Scotland center on accusations that hospital staff are transmitting methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus to patients [3]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also developed a network for molecular subtyping, or fingerprinting, of foodborne pathogens [4]. Because SNPs, insertion/deletion mutations, or sequence repeats may affect or be linked with phenotypic traits such virulence or antibiotic resistance, analysis of variance in polymorphic markers may also contribute to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases[5].
Increasing availability of genomic sequence data makes it possible to predict regions of a genome that display variation among strains or isolates [1]. In the event of a suspected biothreat outbreak, the agent would be completely sequenced; however, full genome sequencing may require weeks or more. Ideally, there should be information immediately available about the hotspots of variation, the key sequence regions or assays that can discriminate among the possible sources of the agent, based on existing sequence data. This demands a full-genome analysis of available sequence data to predict discriminating markers among strains or isolates. Knowledge of and validated assays to query these variable regions for genotyping analyses could then be used to rapidly classify an unknown isolate in terms of its relationship to the already-characterized strains. These results could be available within hours, long before full sequence information becomes available. Once full-sequence information is generated, reliable, automated tools are required to find how this sequence differs or is similar to other strains. Recently, Budowle and colleagues stated that there is a "need for an infrastructure with analytical tools and knowledge bases to rapidly provide investigative leads..." [6].
The needs described above demand a full knowledge of all the SNPs and fragment length polymorphisms (e.g. detectable by PCR-RFLP analyses) that distinguish known isolates. SNPs and PCR-RFLP analyses have been used extensively in genotyping for forensic and epidemiological applications [7-10]. Although extensive experimental bench work or human examination of multiple sequence alignments can illuminate such variations, non-automated analysis is tedious and error-prone, especially for long sequences or when more than a few sequences are available. Existing software programs related to forensics focus on human crime forensics, paternity investigation, and so on, and do not enable full-genome prediction of marker regions or predict the combinations of variable regions that facilitate maximal isolate discrimination with a minimal number of assays [11].
To address this need, we have developed an automated forensic pipeline for SNP and PCR-RFLP optimization, called SPR Opt (SNP PCR-RFLP Optimization). To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive, automated, computational tool that performs the following four steps:
1) identifies all SNPs or PCR-RFLP variations in a set of input sequences that can be as long as whole microbial genomes,
2) groups the co-segregating markers into haplotypes,
3) performs combinatoric analysis on the haplotypes to generate multi-locus solutions to maximally discriminate each of the input sequences from the others,
4) uses simulated annealing to find the best solutions using the smallest total number of haplotypes (that is, the fewest total assays) to discriminate all the input genomes to the maximum degree possible.
Both SNP and PCR-RFLP solutions computed by the SPR Opt software include multiple loci when necessary for maximal sequence discrimination. In this paper, input sequences may also be referred to as genomes. However, the input need not be complete genomes; it can be gene sequences or other fragments from a number of isolates. Here a SNP is considered to be a single polymorphic base surrounded by conserved upstream and downstream sequence [9]. The length of the conserved sequence surrounding a SNP is specified by the user. In future versions of the software under development, a less strict SNP definition will be allowed in which requirements for conservation surrounding the SNP position are relaxed, allowing polymorphisms and indels in the region immediately surrounding the SNP position.
SPR Opt also predicts PCR-RFLP assays to discriminate the input sequences. Those primer pair and restriction enzyme combinations to maximally discriminate the input sequences are identified. For the PCR step, it is assumed that primer pairs must be conserved among all the input sequences. The resulting amplicons are examined for length polymorphisms or sequence variations that would result in differences in fragment length distributions after restriction digest among the multiple input sequences (RFLP). This software elucidates all PCR-RFLP detectable variations, whether they are caused by insertions or deletions of non-repeated sequence, tandem repeats, non-tandem repeats, microsatellites, mutations that alter a restriction site, and so on.
For both SNP and PCR-RFLP analyses, some conservation is required among the input sequences surrounding the variable site, whether it be conserved bases up and downstream of the SNP, or conserved primers surrounding the fragment length polymorphism or RFLP. This ensures that there are not false negatives because the surrounding sequence was not amplified or otherwise detected. For example, detection of SNPs may be performed using a microarray with oligos chosen so that the central base is a SNP, and there are 4 oligos for each conserved surrounding sequence, each representing the SNP position filled with A, T, C, or G, respectively. If there is not a hybridization signal from any of the four oligos, then this serves as an alert that there may be a problem with the reaction conditions or the sample. In contrast, if conserved oligos (sequences surrounding the SNPs) are not used, then it is unclear whether the sample is a variant without that particular SNP, or whether the sample is degraded, the reaction conditions unsuitable, or the target species is not present.
Here it is assumed that a haplotype is a group of markers (SNP or PCR-RFLP) that segregate in the same pattern across the genomes. Any single marker in a given haplotype indicates the identities of the other markers in this haplotype, so that every marker within the haplotype need not be examined. Here it is not assumed that the markers within a given haplotype cluster spatially in any pattern within a given sequence. That is, markers in the same haplotype may be distributed evenly or randomly, and do not necessarily occur within blocks of contiguous sequence. Haplotypes do not necessarily correlate with "hotspots" of mutation. Markers in the same haplotype may be likely to be linked, located in close proximity and inherited as a group, but it is not assumed that this is the case. Indeed, if markers in the same haplotype are separated in the genome, it may indicate that a recombination event has occurred. Alternatively, this pattern could be a result of selection or chance. Such an investigation of how positional information of markers in the same haplotype may indicate recombination is beyond the scope of this paper.
Although the first part of this software depends on locating the SNP or PCR-RFLP sites (step 1 above), the "backend" (steps 2–4 above) of this computational forensics pipeline depends only on the haplotypes. Thus, while the tools are currently coded to work for the SNP or PCR-RFLP analyses described here, any type of marker such as microarray hybridization patterns, microsatellite markers, or even chemical or physical features that differ among isolates could be categorized into haplotypes and fed into the back end of the combinatorial analyses described below.
One question that is investigated here is that of how well phylogenetic trees based on the haplotype splits of PCR-RFLPs or SNPs correspond with those generated from full genome sequence alignments or phenotypic differences. The results presented indicate that trees built solely on forensic markers do not closely match those based on full genome alignments. This finding has important implications for tree generation and interpretation in the absence of sufficient genomic sequence information, since empirical forensic techniques are often used for tree prediction. A second analysis presented is the frequency that different restriction enzymes result in fragment length polymorphisms for the SARS and mumps data.
The impacts of this software are the following: 1) The software provides computational guidance as to an optimal set of assays for genotyping the isolates, particularly helpful when large numbers of sequences or genomes are available. 2) All the SNP or PCR-RFLP variations in the available data are found and grouped into haplotypes. This includes identification of the sequence surrounding a SNP that will be useful in designing the assay (for example, the oligos or primers for an array, ligation, or single base extension reactions), or primer prediction and restriction enzyme selection. If the available sequence data is limited, there is no guarantee that the primers identified will be found in unsequenced strains, although requiring conservation among the sequenced isolates increases the chances of conservation among unsequenced isolates as well.
The application of SPR Opt is illustrated for two viruses for which multiple genomes are publicly available. The software and source code is publicly available and free for non-profit use at .
The output files listed in Table 2 containing the details of these analyses are provided as supplementary information for the web . The main results are summarized in Tables 3, 4, 5. The large number of genomes, variable sites, and character haplotypes illustrate the utility of this software for focusing in on the most informative combinations of sites. Only some of the mumps virus or SARS virus genomes can be uniquely discerned from other genomes of the same species. Unresolved clusters are given in Additional file 2. Computational prediction of PCR amplicon length variation (without restriction digest) for mumps virus indicates there are no variable length amplicons using the parameter values and definitions used here. Therefore, this method when restriction digest is omitted is not appropriate for genotyping mumps virus.
A comparison of the SARS phylograms created using full genome sequences, SNPs, or PCR-RFLPs (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5) illustrate that although there are similarities within the fine branch structure showing the relationship of very similar genomes, the basic structure of the trees differs. Genetic distances, indicated by the lengths of the branches, vary among the trees, and the particular genome clusters predicted to be the least similar (longest branches) contrast among the trees. A tree created from an optimal solution for SNP forensics has little branching structure and homogeneous branch lengths, and does not appear very similar to or to provide as much information as trees created from all the SNP data or from the multiple genome alignment.
Table 6 shows that the ranking of enzymes that most frequently generate RFLP variations in SARS virus are similar but not identical to the rankings for generating RFLP variations in mumps virus.
PCR without restriction digestion was inferior to PCR-RFLP and SNPs for genome discrimination of the viruses examined, although in additional analyses of bacterial genomes, PCR without digestion was adequate for complete genome discrimination (unpublished). When it is possible to choose from a very large number of restriction enzymes, PCR-RFLP may enable a greater level of discrimination than SNP analysis, illustrated by the result that the genomes can be subdivided into more, smaller unresolved clusters using PCR-RFLP than using SNPs. However, this is not always the case: for example the two SARS genomes PUMC03 and Sino1-11 can be discriminated using SNPs but not using PCR-RFLP. If only a small number of restriction enzymes are available, then analyses using SPR Opt indicate that SNPs outperform PCR-RFLP (unpublished). In most cases, either SNPs or PCR-RFLPs can discriminate most genomes, with minor differences in the exact unresolved clusters predicted. In these cases, one may need to use both techniques in order to discern different sets of similar genomes.
Contrasting the phylogenetic trees generated from full genomes, SNPs, or PCR-RFLPs suggests that caution is needed in assessing genome divergence based on forensic/epidemiological data in lieu of full genome sequences, since the isolates predicted to be most divergent may differ across the three measures of variation. In addition, if only the subset of SNPs determined to be optimal for forensic discrimination are queried, phylogenetic trees based on this information may not be representative of the true phylogenic relationships, and may result in particularly poor estimation of branching structure and branch lengths.
Highly heterogeneous viruses like many of the single-stranded RNA viruses (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis virus species, poliovirus, etc.) must be subdivided into clades or other sub-groupings of genetically similar strains even before this software can be applied. Lack of conserved sequence upstream and downstream of a SNP, or lack of conserved primers for PCR amplification, may thwart attempts at SNP or PCR-RFLP discovery at the species level. Instead, one requires subgroups of genomes that are sufficiently similar to locate conserved regions surrounding the forensically informative sites. A future version of the software under development will employ a less restrictive definition of SNPs, allowing some variation surrounding the SNP position.
In addition to SNP and PCR-RFLP analysis like the examples presented here for a given target species, there are many questions one could address with the aid of this software. For example, the character haplotypes and genome groups generated by SPR Opt contain a wealth of information. If there are differences in virulence, host range, or other interesting phenotypic traits, one may examine the list of genome groups to see if there are any whose genome membership corresponds with the phenotypic variation. If so, these may be interesting regions for further biological investigation. For example, in which genes do the corresponding character haplotypes land? Do the nucleotide variations translate into protein sequence differences? One could also take a complementary approach, asking whether SNPs or PCR-RFLPs are clustered in certain genes or intergenic regions. It would also be interesting to examine whether or not SNP locations within a species correspond to regions of relative inter-specific conservation or variation. As mentioned in the introduction, the distribution of co-segregating markers in a given haplotype across the genome sequence might be used to look for evidence of recombination events or correlated selection on multiple genes, as might be observed if genes are in the same pathway or affected by the same environmental factors.
In conclusion, bioinformatic software called SPR Opt is described to optimize SNP and PCR-RFLP analyses in order to provide the maximum amount of genotyping information from the fewest assays at the bench. SPR Opt requires as input a set of sequences and their multiple sequence alignment. This software not only predicts the variable sites based on input sequence data, but also groups these into co-segregating haplotypes and provides guidance as to the ways in which these may maximally discriminate genomes using the fewest possible assays. These are computationally challenging problems that are solved using a bit vector intersection approach to determine sets of haplotypes to maximally discriminate each input genome, as well as parallel simulated annealing to select a subset of the many possible solutions that will enable users to extract the most information from the fewest forensic tests. Analyses of two viruses were presented, and a number of potential investigations using this software are suggested. This is the first comprehensive tool to optimize the selection of forensic markers to maximize information gained from the fewest assays, accepting whole or partial genome sequence data as input. As more sequence data becomes available for multiple strains and isolates of a species, automated, computational approaches such as those described here will be essential to make sense of large amounts of information, and to guide and optimize efforts in the laboratory.
A SNP is defined to be a single polymorphic base surrounded by conserved upstream sequence of length min_len_upstream bases and conserved downstream sequence of length min_len_downstream bases. By conserved sequence, it is meant that the sequence is identical among all input genomes. If the sequence surrounding a SNP occurs more than once or is absent in any of the input genomes (checking both the plus and minus strands), the position is deleted from consideration as a SNP. A polymorphic base differs in one or more of the input genomes. If min_len_downstream and min_len_upstream are greater than zero, then this is a strict definition of SNPs. Insertions or deletions of even a single base are not considered SNPs. The parameters min_len_upstream and min_len_downstream are user-specified. The software finds SNPs using the conservation gestalt; in the conservation gestalt, any dot surrounded by at least min_len_upstream and min_len_downstream letters is a candidate SNP. The sequences indicated by the letters upstream and downstream of the candidate SNP are stored. Using regular expression pattern matching in PERL, the location of the SNP is determined in each of the input genomes. If an exact match to the conserved sequence surrounding the SNP does not occur exactly once in each of the input sequences, then the SNP and its surrounding sequence is eliminated from further consideration. Thus, the SNP is defined by its conserved surrounding sequence, and the position of a SNP within a genome may differ among the genomes.
If a less restrictive definition of a SNP is required, it is possible to set either (but not both) min_len_downstream or min_len_upstream equal to 0, and thus pick up more regions, including those that may be the beginning of insertion/deletion variations among genotypes. This might be a desired approach for the Single Base Extension assay, since only conservation immediately 5' of the variable position matters [9].
The choice of the length requirement for the surrounding conserved sequence is very important. If min_len_upstream and min_len_downstream are too short, then sequence surrounding the SNP is likely to be repeated within a given genome. Since each of the repeats could have a different character at the SNP position, if these candidates are not eliminated then it is not possible to distinguish the case of a sample containing a mixture of multiple genotypes from the case of a sample containing a single strain that has multiple occurrences of the sequence surrounding a candidate SNP position with different bases filling the variable position. In contrast, if min_len_upstream and min_len_downstream are too long, then SNP variation may be overlooked because candidate SNPs are surrounded by an insufficient number of conserved bases. If a microarray chip platform using oligos of length 25 bases is to be used for the assay, then setting min_len_upstream and min_len_downstream equal to 12 will predict 25-mers with the central base position the SNP.
This software excludes degenerate bases (e.g. R = G or A, Y = T or C, etc.) indicated within a given genome from consideration as SNPs. Degenerate bases may be due to polymorphic populations within a given strain or to low quality sequencing, and thus do not deliver a confident characterization of differences between strains.
A PCR-RFLP variation occurs if PCR amplicons or the fragments that result after restriction digest of such amplicons have a different length distribution among the input genomes. Fragment length distributions differ if they have different numbers of fragments or if any of the fragments differ in length.
The fragments are generated by first determining amplicons in which the forward and reverse primers are conserved among all the input genomes. If no restriction digest is to be applied, then an amplicon must differ in length among the input genomes. With restriction digest, the distribution of fragment lengths after cutting the amplicon with restriction enzymes must differ among the genomes. The parameter num_restriction_enzymes may be set equal to 0, 1, 2, or 3, as will be described below. Length variation must be detectable by electrophoresis, since there is a limit to the precision to which lengths can be determined. Here, if all the fragments in each of the genomes are less than 50 bases long, or if there are no differences in fragment lengths among any of the genomes that are at least precision bases, then the amplicon+enzyme combination is not considered to be sufficiently variable.
In order to find candidate regions for PCR-RFLP variation, sequence fragments that may contain a PCR-RFLP marker are selected from the conservation gestalt. These are chosen to be just over the max_amplicon_length, to have at least one variable position (a dot in the gestalt file), and are chosen using a sliding window moving at least jump bases from the start of the previous window. If jump is too large, PCR-RFLP sites may be missed, and if jump is too small, the same insertion/deletion variation may be counted more than once if it is contained within more than one pair of primers. However, all instances of counting the same variable site will appear within the same haploblock, so a simple examination of the markers within a given haploblock sorted by position should indicate those that query the same site as a result of using too small a value for the jump parameter. The software may also be run several times with different values of jump, and the largest value of jump that still provides the greatest discrimination among genomes may be selected.
Second, conserved primer pairs are selected from these fragments using MIT's primer3 software with user-specified parameters. Third, genomes are searched for an exact match to each primer pair on both the plus and minus (reverse complemented) strands, and those primer pairs are discarded in which 1) one or both primers are absent from any of the genomes, 2) one or both primers occur more than once in any of the genomes (with no mismatches), or 3) the forward and reverse primers are too far apart to reliably generate an amplicon in one or more of the genomes. In the analyses here, it is assumed that any distance longer than 1200 bases is too long for amplification, which is reasonable if a short elongation time in the PCR thermocycle is to be used. This value can be changed in the source code.
Amplicons can be cut by 0, 1, 2 or 3 enzymes simultaneously (or sequentially before being run through electrophoresis), as a user-specified option num_restriction_enzymes. Simulated cutting is performed computationally using the regular expression pattern matching function in Perl, and it is assumed that cuts occur in all locations where a given enzyme sequence occurs (that is, the DNA is exposed to the enzyme for a sufficient duration to cut at all the sequence-specific sites).
If the number of restriction enzymes is set to 0, then in the output files the restriction enzyme is indicated as "NONE", and the PCR amplicons must vary in length among the sequences without any restriction digest. If num_restriction_enzymes = 1, then a given PCR product may be digested by only one enzyme at a time before electrophoresis or other empirical measurement of fragment lengths. That is, digestion of the original PCR products with many alternative enzymes may be performed as long as each digestion is followed by its own fragment length measurement. The final solution guiding how to discriminate all the input sequences may involve a number of different enzymes. But when num_restriction_enzymes = 1, digestion is always done only with one enzyme at a time before fragment lengths are measured.
If num_restriction_enzymes = 2 or 3, then digestion can occur with combinations of 2 or 3 enzymes, respectively, before the measurement of fragment lengths occurs after each digestion with a given combination of enzymes. Enzyme combinations should be examined by the user to make sure the buffers and reaction conditions are compatible for all the enzymes in the combination, as the software does not assess enzyme compatibility. Although setting num_restriction_enzymes = 2 or 3 is allowed, it is not clear that users ever need to use these options, since with num_restriction_enzymes = 1, many different enzymes may contribute to the total solution of discriminating all the input genomes, as long as they are not applied simultaneously. All results reported here were computed using num_restriction_enzymes = 1.
The restriction enzymes to be considered are specified by the user. Currently, the software is not implemented for non-palindromic restriction enzymes, although this could be added as a minor modification if required.
First, the software calculates all SNPs or all PCR-RFLPs, as defined above. These are listed in the files SNPs_all or FLPs_all, respectively. "FLP" refers to Fragment Length Polymorphisms, whether the polymorphisms result from PCR amplification or restriction digest length differences. The total number of SNPs is counted as the number of positions that are variable. For PCR-RFLPs, the software reports the total number of unique combinations of primer pair sequences and restriction enzyme(s) that yield variation in fragment length distributions among the genomes, as well as the number of unique fragment length distributions (summed across primer pairs and restriction enzyme combinations).
The second computation the software performs is to divide the SNPs (or PCR-RFLPs) into co-segregating groups of markers called character haplotypes. That is, any two variable markers that distinguish the same set of genomes, and thus provide equivalent forensic/epidemiological information, are considered members of the same character haplotype. The genomes that co-segregate for a particular character haplotype is called the genome group. Genomes are members of multiple genome groups that may overlap in membership, and there may be genome groups that are proper subsets of other genome groups. For easy association, the genome group identification number is the same as the character haplotype identification number. The algorithm to generate the list of character haplotypes and genome groups works in the following way: at each variable site, genomes are grouped by the marker identity ("allele", e.g. SNP character) each genome contains at that locus. Every time a new clustering pattern of genomes occurs, the cluster of genomes defines a new genome group, and the marker is stored in the character haplotype associated with that genome group. If a clustering pattern has already been observed at a locus previously examined, then that allele is added to the list of markers for the associated character haplotype.
The file character_haplotypes contains a listing of the SNPs or PCR-RFLPs contained in each character haplotype, and the file genome_groups gives the associated genome groups. Inspection of these files is useful in additional analyses of sequence clusters (e.g. phylogenetic tree construction based on number of SNPs or PCR-RFLPs supporting a given relationship) or group-level assays (find a haplotype that will distinguish any of genomes A, B, or C from all the others, e.g. discriminate virulent strains from vaccine strains).
The third part of the software computes all sets of 1 or more character haplotype(s) that will maximally discriminate each genome. Each genome requires the testing of one or more polymorphic sites to pull it out from the other genomes. Thus, each solution set to resolve a given genome contains one to many haplotypes (a multi-locus solution). There may be many alternative solution sets for every genome, each of which provide the same information, and it is up to the user to select the one that works the best on the chosen platform.
To find a set of character haplotypes to uniquely discriminate one genome from the rest requires that the intersection of the genomes across the associated genome groups is that single target genome. For example, if genome group 1 (associated with haplotype 1) contains genomes A, B, and C, and genome group 2 (associated with haplotype 2) contains genomes A and D, then the set of haplotypes 1 and 2 can uniquely discriminate genome A. That is, if in an unknown sample, one found a SNP that was included in haplotype 1 and another SNP that was included in haplotype 2, then it would be concluded that the unknown sample was like A, and not B, C, or D.
The combinatoric demands of this step may be substantial. For example, if there are 100 genome groups, then examining the intersections of all possible combinations of 3 genome groups requires 100C3 = 161,700 tests. We represent each genome group as a bit vector of 1's and 0's indicating the membership or exclusion, respectively, of each of the genomes in that genome group. Then all genome groups containing only a single genome (each of the markers in the associated character haplotype uniquely identifies that genome) are reported, as well as all genome group combinations of size = number_combinations_to_test and fewer in which the bitwise AND (intersection) is a single genome. The bit vector approach was the fastest method that was tested by the authors. Thus, all intersections of sets of genome groups are examined, and for each of the input genomes, a search is made for those in which the intersection is uniquely that genome. The maximum number of genome groups per combination that is tested in a multi-locus solution set is the parameter number_combinations_to_test. Thus, combinatorics are performed on number haplotypessCnumber_combinations_to_test total combinations.
If there is not an intersection that contains uniquely the target genome, the intersections that contain the fewest other genomes in addition to the target genome is reported as the solution set for that target. Thus, if the target in question cannot be uniquely discriminated, the most specific level to which it can be discerned is output. The other genomes in solution set i for genome A is represented as the list others(i,A).
When there are many genomes and many genome groups, it may be necessary to take two additional steps to find the combinations to maximally discriminate sequences. For example, there may be hundreds of genome groups, so that the number_combinations_to_test must be set at the low value of 2 in order for the combinatoric step to finish in a reasonable amount of time (hours or less). First, if there are two preliminary solutions i ≠ j where others(i,A) ≠ others(j,A), new combinatorics are performed on only the union of the genome groups that comprise all preliminary solutions for the genome A under consideration. Since the number of genome groups making up all preliminary solutions for the specific genome A is a small subset of the total number of genome groups, testing all possible combinations (not just combinations up to a given size) computes rapidly. This generates new solution sets, each of which contains more genome groups than the preliminary solution sets. Each of these new solution sets for the given genome has an identical list of others(A), so that the index i may be dropped.
A second step is sometimes required to find maximally discriminating multi-locus combinations in situations with large numbers of genomes and genome groups. For genome B that is in the list of others(A), if the size of others(B) < size of others(A), then one should be able to discriminate genome A to a higher level (with fewer others(A)), if more genome groups are included in the solution set. In this case, the program cycles through all genome groups, adding the first genome group encountered to the solution sets for A that contain genome A but not genome B. Although taking the first acceptable genome group may not be the best (that is, may not cause the greatest reduction possible in the list others(A)), this method is fast and does give a good solution in the many test cases examined. The list of others(A) is then recomputed with the new genome group included in the solution set, and this process is repeated for all genomes in the list others(A). We repeat this procedure for all the genomes that cannot be uniquely discriminated. This generates final solution set(s) for each genome that may contain many more genome groups than the original combinatoric size number_combinations_to_test.
The first step described above is performed automatically based on results of comparing lists of others(i,A) with others(j,A) for all i ≠ j. The second step is computed automatically based on results of comparing others(A) with others(B) for all genomes A and B. These extra steps are rarely needed, since in most cases, there are few enough genome groups to select a sufficiently large value of number_combinations_to_test to find optimal solution sets with the fewest possible genome groups for each genome, rather than to find acceptable (but possibly sub-optimal) solution sets containing more than number_combinations_to_test genome groups. These steps were required for analyses of SARS virus. All solution sets for each genome are given in the file all_discriminating_sets.
There is a third option for speeding up the combinatorics of the process of finding sets of genome groups that maximally discriminate each genome: this is to exclude consideration of those genome groups with many genomes from the combinatoric calculations. This step yields a set of "pared groups". Since genome groups with many genomes provide the poorest discrimination among those genomes, it is reasonable to only consider the genome groups with the fewest genomes. This is an optional parameter pare_groups that can be set to 1. If pare_groups = 1 then the algorithm finds the cutoff number of genomes per genome group below which there are genome groups that together contain all the input genomes. Then only the haplotypes that contain fewer than this cutoff number of genomes are considered in the combinatoric steps described above. This option may result in orders of magnitude improvement in algorithm speed and memory for situations in which there are a large number of genome groups.
When genomes cannot be uniquely distinguished at the single genome level, the maximally discriminating genome groups are referred to as unresolved clusters. For complete isolate-level discrimination of all the input genomes, the number of unresolved clusters must equal the number of genomes.
Finally, the combinations of solution sets for each genome are found that enable the testing of the fewest total character haplotypes (i.e. that are associated with the fewest genome groups). For the example shown in Figure 1, either set 1 or set 2 can differentiate genome C. If set 1 is used, then membership in four haplotypes (Ht 2, 3, 4, and 5) must be queried to discern both C and D, but if set 2 is chosen instead, then only 3 haplotypes (Ht 3, 4, and 5) need to be examined. A similar analysis would take place to determine the minimum number of character haplotypes to maximally discriminate all the genomes A-F shown in Figure 1.
When many of the genomes can be discriminated by multiple alternative solution sets, the number of possible set combinations across all the genomes is the product of the number of solution sets for each genome. Unpublished analyses show that the number of possible set combinations can skyrocket to over 1030 combinations, far too many to do an exhaustive search for the global optimum solution that minimizes the number of character haplotypes to be examined. Therefore, simulated annealing was used to search for approximately optimal solutions using the Metropolis algorithm. Forty parallel processes of simulated annealing were run, and from these the best solutions were selected. The best score is the minimum number of haplotypes that must be examined. The file sim_anneal_results_summary lists the combinations of set numbers (each set is a set of haplotypes) for each genome that enable the fewest haplotypes to be tested overall. Each row is a different solution from simulated annealing that has the same score, that is, each row contains a list of set numbers, one set for each genome, characterizing the combination of sets. The set numbers correspond to the set numbers given in the file all_discriminating_sets, and are not the same as the genome group or character haplotype numbers. Many of these simulated annealing solutions are very similar to one another. For test cases examined in which there were fewer than 107 possible set combinations, we verified that simulated annealing predicted the true global optimum.
For the analyses described below, the following parameter values were used for SNP analyses: min_len_upstream = 7 and min_len_downstream = 7. The minimum length of conserved upstream and downstream bases was selected to be 7 because it enabled a finer level of genome discrimination than did 12-mers (which would correspond with Affymetrix chip 25-mers with the central base being either a perfect match or a mismatch).
For the PCR-RFLP analyses described here, the max_amplicon_length = 1000. Amplicons of length 900–1000 bases are specified as preferred, although shorter amplicons are allowed if longer ones cannot be found. Other parameters are: jump = 500 when num_restriction_enzymes = 1, jump = 200 when num_restriction_enzymes = 0, and precision = 5. Primer3 parameters in the file p3.params.pcr.primers as well as a file listing the restriction enzymes used in the computations are available for download at .
SNP and PCR-RFLP analyses were performed using SPR Opt on 102 genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (~30 Kb) and 17 genomes of mumps virus (~15 Kb) that were publicly available at the time the analyses were done. The Genbank genome identification information for these is given in Additional file 1. The multiple sequence alignments were generated using Multiple Genome Aligner [13].
Three phylogenetic trees for SARS virus were constructed based on 1) a full genome multiple sequence alignment, 2) SNPs, and 3) PCR-RFLPs. Newick trees were created using the PHYLIP software package [14,15], using the neighbor program to generate the trees based on a distance matrix of pairwise distances between the genomes. For the multiple sequence alignment, the dnadist program using maximum likelihood was used to generate the distance matrix. For SNPs and PCR-RFLPs, distance matrices were created by summarizing the data contained in the genome groups and character haplotypes. This was required because the raw listing of SNPs and PCR-RFLPs necessarily differed in format, while the genome group formatting was consistent between the SNP and the PCR-RFLP data so the same algorithm could be used to generate phylogenetic trees from each method. For the SNP data, the algorithm described below was validated by comparing the resulting phylogenetic tree with that created from a standard SNP matrix, also described below.
To calculate a distance matrix from the genome group data, first, each genome group was weighted by the number of SNPs or the number of PCR primers (for PCR-RFLP) contained in the associated character haplotype. For PCR-RFLPs, the weight was not increased if two or more alternative enzymes cutting the same amplicon (i.e. from the same set of primers) gave the same pattern of genome segregation, since in the runs described, there were many possible enzymes that provided the same information about genome relationships after cutting a single amplicon, and this might artificially increase the weight. After the weights were calculated, then for all possible pairs of genomes, each genome group was examined, and each time a genome group contained both of the genomes, the weight of that genome group was subtracted from the total distance score between that pair of genomes. After all the pairwise distances were calculated, a constant equal to the minimum (negative) distance was subtracted from each pairwise distance, so that none of the distances would be negative. The distance matrices for each of the SNP and the PCR-RFLP analyses were used in the PHYLIP neighbor program. The resulting phylogenetic trees (phylograms) were drawn using a web interface [16]. A phylogenetic tree was also created in a similar manner to that described above except based on only the SNP genome groups in one randomly chosen optimal set solution listed in the results from simulated annealing (that is, a set of the minimum number of haplotypes to maximally discriminate all the input genomes). Such a tree would represent a purported phylogeny if only the data from a set chosen for maximum forensic discrimination is used to predict phylogenetic relationships.
To verify that this method of creating a distance matrix from the genome group data provides an accurate picture for the SNP data, a distance matrix was created from a traditional SNP matrix. In the SNP matrix, columns correspond to the SNPs, and rows correspond to the isolates. This matrix, containing every SNP in the data set, was used in the dnadist algorithm of PHYLIP using the maximum likelihood option. The tree generated was identical to that created using the algorithm described above calculating distances from the genome groups.
The total number of times that each restriction enzyme created a different distribution of fragment lengths was summed across all amplicons in the PCR-RFLP analyses. This was done simply by counting the frequency of occurrence of each enzyme in the file FLPs_all (Table 6).

30. CXCR2 is critical for dsRNA-induced lung injury: relevance to viral lung infection
Viral infections of the respiratory tract are a cause of the common cold and flu in children and adults. These infections may predispose certain patients to develop chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [1]. Clinical symptoms include mucus secretion and altered airway reactivity and are hallmarked by the recruitment of inflammatory cells with resultant changes to the airway epithelial cell lining. Inflammation can also extend further into the lung to cause parenchymal disease that is characteristic of viral pneumonia as has been observed recently in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2]. Inflammatory cell recruitment in large part is elicited by the generation of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) that are also important in establishing a pro-inflammatory environment underlying chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and BPD [1,3-10].
Inflammatory changes due to viral infection result from the host immune response rather than secondary to viral replication or the viral particles themselves [11-15]. Viral infections of epithelial cells are characterized by the generation of the pro-inflammatory molecule double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during intracellular replication of viruses. When studied in human epithelial cell lines in vitro, dsRNA triggers an innate immune response in host cells via generation of cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammatory cell recruitment. Specifically, dsRNA has been shown to induce activation of the neutrophil chemoattractant, interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8), and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) [16]. In human subjects in vivo, elevated tracheal IL-8/CXCL8 levels and neutrophil accumulation are found in airways of patients with asthma, COPD, and viral infection. While animal models in vivo have largely studied the systemic effects of intraperitoneal dsRNA treatment [17], there is a paucity of information on characterization and role of chemokines in lung inflammation and injury following intratracheal dsRNA instillation.
Murine KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 are Glutamic acid-Leucine-Arginine-positive (ELR-positive) CXC chemokines; are structural homologs of human GRO-α/CXCL1 and GRO-β/γ/CXCL2/3, respectively; and are functional homologs of human CXC chemokines, such as IL-8/CXCL8, ENA-78/CXCL5, and GRO-α/β/γ/CXCL1/2/3 [18-21]. Both murine chemokines share the ability to signal through a G protein-coupled receptor, CXCR2 [18-20]. Their human structural and functional homologs have been associated with asthma, COPD, and viral infections of the lung [22,23].
In the current study, we hypothesized that the early inflammation and resultant lung injury from intratracheal dsRNA treatment is due, in part, to the expression of ELR-positive CXC chemokines through their interaction with their major receptor, CXCR2. To test this hypothesis, we injected dsRNA intratracheally into 6–8 week old female BALB/c mice to measure neutrophil and chemokine responses and resultant injury in the airway and lung tissue compartments. We then blocked this response by pretreating animals with antibodies to specifically neutralize neutrophil recruitment in a chemokine-dependent manner and thereby decreased lung inflammation and injury. Our animal model demonstrates the critical role of CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 in acute lung inflammation and injury due to intratracheal dsRNA.
Capture and Detection antibodies to murine KC/CXCL1 and murine MIP-2/CXCL2/3 were purchased as DuoSet® from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).
Neutralization studies: Purified rat anti-mouse Ly-6G (Gr-1) mAb (clone RB6-8C5) was purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and was used for neutrophil depletion studies as previously described [24]. Polyclonal goat anti-murine CXCR2 was produced by the immunization of a goat with a peptide containing the ligand-binding sequence Met-Gly-Glu-Phe-Lys-Val-Asp-Lys-Phe-Asn-Ile-Glu-Asp-Phe-Phe-Ser-Gly of CXCR2 [24-31]. The goat was immunized with CXCR2 in multiple intradermal sites with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) followed by at least 3 boosts of CXCR2 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) as previously described. [24-31]. Direct ELISA was used to evaluate antisera titers, and sera was used for Western blot, ELISA and neutralization assays when titers had reached greater than 1/1,000,000. The CXCR2 protein sequence has been shown to contain the ligand-binding portion of the CXCR2 receptor [24-26,32]. The anti-CXCR2 antibodies have been used previously to block mouse CXCR2 in vivo, and has been shown to detect CXCR2 by Western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of neutrophils in vivo [24-26,32]. The anti-CXCR2 antibody has been shown to be neutralizing using both in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis assay and in vivo by abrogating the influx of neutrophils into the peritoneum of normal mice in response to exogenous ELR-positive murine CXC chemokines [24-26,32]. In vivo administration of anti-CXCR2 antibodies inhibited pulmonary neutrophil sequestration in murine models of Aspergillosis, Nocardia, and Pseudomonas pneumonia and prevented the influx of neutrophils in urine and the kidney in a murine model of Escherichia coli urinary tract infection [24-26,32]. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of this antibody did not alter peripheral blood neutrophil counts [24-26,32]. 1 ml of antiserum against mCXCR2 and control antibody is approximately 10 mg of IgG.
We used 6–8 week old female BALB/c mice to intratracheally inject either single-stranded (ssRNA) or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) using a modification of a previously described method [30,33-36]. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (60 mg/kg) intraperitoneally; then, under sterile conditions, the anterior neck soft tissue was dissected to expose the trachea and 50 μl RNA (20 μg/μl; 40 μg/g mouse wt) was injected via 26 gauge tuberculin needle and syringe attached to a Stepper® microinjector (Indicon, Inc., Brookfield, CT) into the trachea under direct visualization. Immediately following the instillation, the skin was apposed and closed using tissue adhesive and the mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia prior to replacement into their cages.
In separate experiments, animals received either 1 ml of goat polyclonal anti-murine CXCR2, 1 ml of normal goat serum (NGS) control antibody, or 0.5 ml rat anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb or corresponding control intraperitoneally 24 hours before intratracheal injection and daily until time of sacrifice as previously described [37].
At time of sacrifice, 72 h following intratracheal dsRNA or ssRNA treatment, mice were euthanized using intraperitoneal Pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and a heparinized sample of blood was harvested. The thoracic cavity was then exposed and lungs were perfused free of blood with 1 ml 0.9% normal saline via the spontaneously beating right ventricle under constant pressure of 25 cm H20. A 26 gauge butterfly needle was used to cannulate the trachea and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed by instilling 1 ml PBS + 5 mM EDTA solution as previously described [38]. Lungs were lavaged under constant pressure of 25 cm H20 and retrieved solutions were centrifuged at 900 × g for 15 min. The cell-free supernatants were assayed by specific ELISAs and collected cells were analyzed for total cell counts and cytospin differentials. Lung tissue was then processed for the following: calculation of lung edema; microvascular permeability; mRNA; ELISA analysis; and histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis by fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 to 30 cm H2O pressure and embedding in paraffin.
Paraffin-embedded tissues from dsRNA-treated and ssRNA-treated lungs were processed for immunohistochemical localization of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression using a method previously described [33,39]. Briefly, tissue sections were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated through graded concentrations of ethanol. Tissue nonspecific binding sites were blocked using Power Block® (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA). Tissue sections were overlaid with 1:50 dilution of either control (goat) or polyclonal goat anti-TLR3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The tissue sections were washed with TRIS-buffered saline and then incubated for 60 min with secondary biotinylated antibody. The tissue sections were then washed in TRIS-buffered saline and incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to streptavidin (BioGenex). Tissue sections were then incubated with Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) followed by the peroxidase substrate, DAB reagent (Vector Laboratories). After optimal color development, tissue sections were immersed in sterile water, counterstained with Lerners hematoxyin, and cover slipped using an aqueous mounting solution.
Total cellular RNA from lung tissue was isolated as previous described [30,31]. Total RNA was determined and 1 ug of total RNA was reversed transcribed into cDNA and amplified using TaqMan Gene Expression Quantification assays (Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Kit 4304134). cDNA was amplified and quantified using the TaqMan 7700 Sequence Detection System and specific primers for murine CXCL1, murine CXCL2/3, murine CXCR2 and a housekeeping gene18S. The primers used were 5'-TGA-GCT-GCG-CTG-TCA-GTG-CCT-3' (sense) and 5'-AGA-AGC-CAG-CGT-TCA-CCA-GA-3' (antisense) for CXCL1 (259 bp) and 5'-GCT-GGC-CAC-CAA-CCA-CCA-GG-3' (sense) and 5'-AGC-GAG-GCA-CAT-CAG-GTA-CG-3' (antisense) for murine CXCL2/3 (359 bp). Predeveloped assay reagents (Applied Biosystems Kit 4304134) were used for murine CXCR2 and the housekeeping gene, 18S. Quantitative analysis of gene expression was done using the comparative CT (ΔCT) methods, in which CT is the threshold cycle number (the minimum number of cycles needed before the product can be detected)[40,41]. The arithmetic formula for the ΔCT method is the difference in threshold cycles for a target, (i.e., CXCR2) and an endogenous reference (i.e., housekeeping gene 18S). The amount of target normalized to an endogenous reference (i.e., CXCR2 in dsRNA-treated animals) and relative to a calibration normalized to an endogenous reference (i.e., CXCR2 in ssRNA-treated controls) is given by 2-ΔΔCT [40,41]. The following is an example for comparing CXCR2 expression from dsRNA-treated animals and ssRNA-treated controls. Both CXCR2 from dsRNA-treated and ssRNA-treated controls are normalized to 18S: ΔΔCT = ΔCT (CXCR2 expression from dsRNA-treated animals normalized to endogenous 18S)-ΔCT (CXCR2 expression from ssRNA-treated controls normalized to endogenous 18S). The calculation of 2-ΔΔCT then gives a relative value when comparing the target with the calibrator, which we designate in this context as fold increase of dsRNA-treated animals to ssRNA-treated controls of the target mRNA relative quantification.
Microvascular permeability related to lung injury was measured using a modification of the Evans blue dye extravasation technique, as previously described [30,42]. Extravasation of Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich) into the extravascular compartment was used as a quantitative measure of lung injury and changes in microvasculature permeability. Briefly, each animal received 20 mg/kg Evans blue (pH 7.34) by tail vein injection 3 h before sacrifice. At the time of sacrifice, a heparinized sample of blood was harvested, and plasma was removed by centrifugation. Six lungs from each group were perfused free of blood with 1 ml 0.9% normal saline via the spontaneously beating right ventricle and removed from the thoracic cavity. The trachea, mainstem bronchi, and surrounding mediastinal structures were removed. Evans blue was extracted from pulmonary tissues after homogenization in 1 ml of 0.9% normal saline. This volume was added to 2 vol of deionized formamide and incubated at 60C for 12 h. The supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 2000 × G for 30 min. Evans blue in the plasma and lung tissue was quantitated by dual-wavelength spectrophotometric analysis at 620 and 740 nm [43]. This method corrects the specimen's absorbance at 620 nm for the absorbance of contaminating heme pigments, using the following formula: corrected absorbance at 620 nm = actual absorbance at 620 nm – (1.426(absorbance at 740) + 0.03). We calculated a permeability index by dividing the correct pulmonary plasma Evans blue absorbance at 620 nm; this index reflects the degree of extravasation of Evans blue into the extravascular pulmonary tissue compartment.
To quantitate lung edema following dsRNA treatment, wet to dry weight ratios were obtained by ligating the lungs away from the hilum as previously described [40]. The lungs were blotted dry and weighed. They were then desiccated by incubation at 130°C overnight in a vacuum oven and re-weighed to determine their dry weight. The wet to dry ratio was then calculated.
KC/CXCL1 or MIP-2/CXCL2/3 protein was quantitated using a modification of a double ligand method as previously described [30,31,40,41]. Briefly, flat-bottomed 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc Immuno-Plate I 96-F) were coated with 50 μl/well of capture antibody to murine KC/CXCL1 or MIP-2/CXCL2/3 (2 ug/ml in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), for 12 hrs at room temperature and then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20 (wash buffer). Microtiter plate nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS and incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. Plates were washed three times with wash buffer and samples or standard were added, followed by incubation for 1 hour at 37°C. Plates were washed three times and 50 μl/well of detection antibody for murine KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 antibodies added, and plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C. Plates were washed three times, streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) added, and the plates incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Plates were washed three times and TMB (3,3,'5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) chromogen substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) added. The plates were incubated at room temperature to the desired extinction, and the reaction terminated with 3 M H2SO4 solution. Plates were read at 450 nm in an automated microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Standards were 1/2-log dilutions of either KC/CXCL1 or MIP-2/CXCL2/3 from 100 ng to 1 pg/ml (50 ul/well). This ELISA method consistently detected specific chemokine concentrations in a linear fashion greater than 50 pg/ml. KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 were specific in our sandwich ELISA without cross-reactivity to a panel of cytokines including murine C10, JE, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, human GROα, GROβ, GROγ, RANTES, and members of the CXC and CC chemokine families.
Whole lung single cell suspensions were made from harvested lungs from four mice per group using a method, as previously described [40]. Single cell suspensions (5 × 106 cells /ml) were stained with Abs: Tricolor-conjugated (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) anti-murine CD45 (Caltag Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), FITC-conjugated anti-murine MOMA-2 (macrophage surface marker; Seratec, Raleigh, NC), R-Phycoerythrin (R-PE) conjugated Rat anti-murine Ly-6G (neutrophil surface marker) and R-PE-conjugated mouse anti-murine CD3e (lymphocyte surface marker) (BD Biosciences). Dual-color-stained cell suspensions were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) using CellQuest 3.2.1f1 software (BD Immunocytometry Systems).
Data were analyzed using the Microsoft® Excel 2000 statistical package (Microsoft Corporation, USA). Two group comparisons were evaluated using the unpaired Students t test. Three group comparisons were evaluated by the ANOVA test with the post hoc analysis (i.e. Bonferroni/Dunn). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM.
Since in vitro studies in human epithelial cells have demonstrated that dsRNA induces the generation of chemokines involved in leukocyte recruitment, we performed in vivo studies using a murine model system of intratracheal dsRNA-induced inflammation and injury to mimic an acute viral infection and thus dissect the mechanisms related to this process. The putative receptor for dsRNA has been identified as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), thus we first determined whether dsRNA treatment was associated with expression of TLR3. Immunolocalization using goat anti-murine TLR3 Ab showed markedly increased expression of TLR3 localized to the surface airway epithelium of dsRNA-treated lungs as compared to ssRNA-treated controls at 72 h. Specificity to TLR3 was demonstrated by lack of staining on control goat IgG-stained sections from both dsRNA and ssRNA-treated groups (Fig. 1).
Mice treated with intratracheal dsRNA were noted to have significant intraparenchymal and airway leukocyte infiltration at 72 h following treatment as compared to naïve and ssRNA-treated controls as demonstrated by histopathology (Fig. 2A). No significant differences in cellular infiltrates were noted among the histopathologic groups at earlier timepoints 4, 12, 24, and 48 h following dsRNA treatment (data not shown). FACS and BAL analysis at 72 h following dsRNA treatment specifically showed that dsRNA induced significant neutrophil recruitment compared to controls (Fig. 2B and 2C).
To determine if the influx of neutrophils into lung airways and parenchyma results in lung injury, we measured two markers of lung injury to quantify changes in lung edema and lung vascular permeability. Results showed a significant increase in the wet:dry ratio in dsRNA-treated lungs as compared to controls at 72 h following dsRNA treatment (Fig. 3A). Similarly, measurement of the lung:plasma extravasation ratio of Evans blue dye also showed a significant increase in microvascular permeability in dsRNA-treated lungs as compared to controls (Fig. 3B).
With the finding that an increase in lung neutrophils coincided with an increase in lung injury in dsRNA-treated lungs, we next attempted to determine if this was a causal relationship by inducing neutropenia and measuring changes in lung neutrophil influx and lung injury. Mice were passively immunized with specific anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb or corresponding control at -24 h as well as 0, 24, and 48 h following dsRNA treatment. Lungs were harvested at 72 h and results showed that animals pretreated with neutrophil depleting mAb had a significant decrease in total neutrophil counts in both lung tissue and airways as compared to controls as reflected by FACS analysis and BAL (Fig. 4A and 4B). Importantly, BAL samples of animals pretreated with anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb antibody showed a specific reduction in neutrophil number but no reduction in monocyte numbers (data not shown). Furthermore, neutrophil depletion resulted in decreased lung microvascular permeability back to baseline values (Fig. 4C).
Since neutrophil influx was shown to result in lung injury in dsRNA-treated lungs, we next identified which specific factors, such as chemokines, were responsible for neutrophil recruitment. We focused on the ELR+ chemokines KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3, which are known to have neutrophil chemoattractant properties. DsRNA treatment resulted in significant increases in lung KC/CXCL1 mRNA levels as well as in protein levels from whole lung homogenates and BAL when compared to controls (Fig. 5A, C, and 5E) at 72 h following dsRNA treatment. Similarly, mRNA levels and lung protein expression of MIP-2/CXCL2/3 were also significantly elevated with an increasing trend noted in BAL protein from dsRNA-treated lungs as compared to controls (Fig. 5B, D, and 5F). Levels of CXCR2 chemokine ligands at earlier timepoints showed only a small increase (two-fold) in the induction of KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 as early as 4 h following dsRNA-exposure (data not shown), but the maximal increase (>ten-fold for KC/CXCL1 and >four-fold for MIP-2/CXCL2/3) occurred at 72 h following dsRNA-exposure.
CXCR2 is the shared cellular receptor for the murine CXC chemokine ligands KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 [18-20]. The finding of increased levels of KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 associated with dsRNA-induced neutrophil sequestration and lung injury led us to evaluate the expression of CXCR2 mRNA in the lungs of these animals. Lung homogenates from dsRNA-treated animals had significantly increased CXCR2 mRNA expression as compared to controls (Fig. 6). The expression of CXCR2 mRNA paralleled its ligand expression, neutrophil sequestration, and lung injury at 72 h following dsRNA treatment (Figs. 2, 3, and 5).
To better understand the mechanism partly responsible for dsRNA-induced lung neutrophilia and injury, we determined whether inhibiting CXCR2 ligand interaction with CXCR2 significantly decreased neutrophil recruitment during the pathogenesis of dsRNA-induced lung injury. Mice were passively immunized with specific neutralizing anti-murine CXCR2 or with control antibody at -24 h, as well as 0, 24, and 48 h following dsRNA treatment. Lungs were harvested at 72 h and results showed that BAL neutrophil counts from animals that received anti-CXCR2 Ab were significantly reduced as compared to control animals that received normal goat serum (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, measurement of lung edema and lung microvascular permeability also showed significant decreases in wet:dry and Evans blue extravasation in mice treated with anti-CXCR2 compared to NGS-treated controls (Fig. 7B and 7C). Finally, histopathologic comparison of lung fields from anti-CXCR2 pretreated mice showed marked reduction in leukocytic infiltrate as compared to NGS-pretreated controls (Fig. 7D).
Respiratory viral infections are characterized by a two-component immune response comprised of an innate component that is fully functional before viral entry into the epithelium and an adaptive component that develops in response to the continued presence of the virus [1]. The innate or acute inflammatory component is associated with a predominance of infiltrating neutrophils. While many viral infections of the lung are self-limiting, the associated lung injury due to this initial event may be critical in establishing a pro-inflammatory environment underlying certain chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, viral pneumonia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [1,3-10]. The host's inflammatory response to viral replication leads to pulmonary pathology hallmarked by leukocyte infiltrate and resultant microvascular leak that progresses to lung edema and the clinical signs of pneumonia. As the lung injury persists or recurs with multiple subsequent viral infections, pulmonary vascular and airway remodeling may occur and eventually lead to development of airway hyper-reactivity and/or interstitial fibrosis [44]. Viral infections are mediated by dsRNA, a proinflammatory molecule generated during viral replication. DsRNA binds to its cell surface receptor, TLR3, and activates the production of downstream gene products, such as CXC chemokines. In this study, we hypothesized that the interaction between CXCR2 and ELR-positive CXC chemokines expressed during dsRNA-induced lung inflammation is critical in mediating neutrophil recruitment, a pivotal process required for dsRNA induced lung injury in viral infections.
Previous studies have demonstrated that mice exposed to a live virus via intranasal inoculation generate a systemic acute-phase response with maximal pulmonary chemokine response at one week that includes both CC and CXC chemokines and is mouse strain-dependent (response in BALB/c greater than in C57BL/6 mice) [45,46]. A similar study using intratracheal delivery of live virus also demonstrated marked pulmonary pathology including mucous cell metaplasia and airway epithelial remodeling [47]. Another study focusing specifically on the effects of intratracheal dsRNA at a low dose found similar systemic inflammatory effects but specific pulmonary effects only when dsRNA was delivered in conjunction with IFNγ [48]. Finally, a recent study examined the effects of inhibiting the CC chemokine receptor, CCR1, during live-virus exposure in mice and showed that mortality during pneumovirus infection was decreased [49]. The present study extends these findings by first determining the effects of high-dose intratracheal dsRNA alone on neutrophil recruitment and lung injury in BALB/c mice and then subsequently blocking these effects via inhibition of the CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR2.
To determine the effects of dsRNA in vivo, we first characterized our murine model by performing a time-course of dsRNA to observe histopathologic changes at 0, 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h following intratracheal dsRNA delivery. We used a maximal dose of dsRNA at 40 μg/g mouse wt after initial studies at lower doses (4 μg/g and 20 μg/g) showed minimal leukocytic infiltrate. Furthermore, we are aware of only one other publication that describes intratracheal dsRNA delivery that showed no effects when used alone at low concentration (10 ug/g) [48]. Histopathological analysis demonstrated a significantly increased leukocytic infiltrate at 72 h following intratracheal dsRNA as compared to earlier time points. We thus chose this observation as the basis to focus upon the 72 h timepoint. Other studies using administration of dsRNA in BALB/c mice in vivo have also shown a maximal innate immune response starting at 72 h following dsRNA exposure [50] Further characterization at 72 h following intratracheal dsRNA showed that neutrophils were a predominant cell type and that there was an associated injury to alveolar-capillary membrane integrity as shown by increased lung edema and microvascular leak.
Having characterized the histopathological damage caused by intratracheal dsRNA, we then focused on the underlying mechanisms responsible for promoting the inflammation and subsequent lung injury. Our findings of a significant increase in neutrophil infiltration following dsRNA treatment are consistent with findings from previous studies using a live virus that also resulted in early neutrophil infiltration [47]. In order to determine whether neutrophil influx was causally linked to the lung injury observed in our system, we performed studies using a monoclonal antibody to the Ly6G antigen on the surface of mouse granulocytes to specifically deplete neutrophils. These results showed decreased numbers of lung neutrophils by FACS analysis and BAL as expected with no reduction in monocyte number, and also showed a decrease in lung microvascular leak and therefore decreased lung injury associated with decreased neutrophil recruitment. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in recruiting these neutrophils remained to be fully elucidated.
Elegant in vitro studies have demonstrated that dsRNA can induce IL-8 expression from human bronchial epithelial cells [16]. Furthermore, in vivo studies using live virus have also demonstrated that CXC chemokines are generated during lung inflammation [45-47]. Having demonstrated that lung injury due to intratracheal dsRNA is dependent on neutrophil infiltration, we determined that CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 expression was significantly greater in the lungs of dsRNA-treated mice than in lungs of ssRNA-treated controls. Furthermore, expression of CXCR2 mRNA was similarly increased in parallel to the production of both CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 ligands and neutrophil sequestration during dsRNA-induced lung inflammation. Other studies of inflammatory diseases, such as ventilator-induced lung injury, pneumonia, and hyperoxia-induced lung injury have demonstrated the importance of CXCR2 expression and its role in neutrophil recruitment during the pathogenesis of these diseases [24,40,41,51]. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that augmented levels of CXCR2 ligands are important in the recruitment of neutrophils during the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and suggest that the interaction between CXCR2 ligands and CXCR2 may be pivotal in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung during dsRNA-induced lung injury.
Based on these findings, we performed proof of principle studies in vivo using an antibody-mediated neutralization strategy to evaluate the direct role for CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 ligands and their interaction with CXCR2 during the pathogenesis of dsRNA-induced lung injury. The anti-CXCR2 Ab-treated mice demonstrated significant reductions specific toneutrophil infiltration that were paralleled by a decrease in lung injury. This suggests that if other leukocytes are recruited there are redundant pathways involved in their recruitment that are CXCR2-independent. Our findings are similar to previous neutralization studies in virus-infected mice that showed functional antagonism to the chemokine receptor CCR1 reduced mortality [49]. Our study is the first to demonstrate that neutralization of CXCR2 results in decreased neutrophil recruitment and lung injury induced by intratracheal dsRNA.
TLR3 is a pattern-recognition cell surface receptor that is responsible for specifically recognizing extracellular dsRNA [52]. It is a member of a family of toll-like receptors (TLRs) that aid the host in combating infections when microbial pathogens bind to their specific toll-like receptor to trigger NFκB and downstream generation of cytokines and costimulatory molecules during the innate immune attack. TLR3 thus plays an important role in host defense against viral infections. Our study showed that dsRNA treatment induced the expression of TLR3 on the cell surface of airways as compared to ssRNA-treated controls animals. The upregulation of TLR3 in dsRNA-exposed mouse airways suggests a positive feedback system in which epithelial cells exposed to dsRNA increase TLR3 expression on their cell surface. A similar upregulation of TLR3 has previously been described in epithelial cells in vitro treated with Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)[53]. These findings are also consistent with in vivo studies using monoclonal antibody to TLR3 and genetic knockout mice of TLR3 [52,54] that establish the role of TLR3 in dsRNA recognition and raise the interesting possibility that TLR3 may be involved in the signaling pathway mediating dsRNA induction of CXC chemokines.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the biological axis of CXCR2 ligand/CXCR2 signaling plays a pivotal role in mediating neutrophil recruitment and dsRNA-induced lung injury. This mechanism may be critical for the promotion of further lung injury and remodeling in patients who eventually develop chronic lung diseases such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The findings of the current study support the contention that CXCR2 ligands and CXCR2 mediate dsRNA-induced lung injury, and may be a therapeutic target to attenuate this pathology.

31. Persistence of lung inflammation and lung cytokines with high-resolution CT abnormalities during recovery from SARS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected more than 8 thousand patients in 22 countries causing 774 deaths between July 2002 and September 2003 [1]. SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the causative agent [2]. Typical clinical manifestations include fever, cough, dyspnea and rapid progression of pulmonary infiltration or consolidation [3]. The mean mortality rate is 9.6% [1], mostly attributed to hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the acute phase, typical pathological findings in the lungs include mononuclear cells infiltration, alveolar cell desquamation and hyaline membrane formation [4]. Those mononuclear cells may develop into multinucleated giant cells [4]. Proinflammatory cytokines released by alveolar macrophages may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis in SARS [5]. Marked elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12, of the Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ, and of chemokines IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IFN-α-induced protein-10 (IP-10) have been reported [6]. High resolution Computed tomography (HRCT) findings at presentation include as unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral or bilateral areas of consolidation [7-9]. Such residual abnormalities have been described also after discharge from hospital at 36.5 days and at 6-months [10,11]. However, limited information is available on recovery of inflammatory abnormalities during recovery from SARS, particularly at 60 days and beyond..
In the current study, we conducted a study to examine HRCT changes in patients who recovered from the acute phase of SARS at days 60 and 90, and measured the associated inflammatory profiles directly by examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We also examined the presence of coronavirus in BALF. We found persistence of HRCT abnormalities and of lung inflammation at day 60, and determined retrospectively the potential influence of pulse corticosteroid therapy in this process.
Twelve (9 women and 3 men, aged 18 to 51 years) of 28 confirmed SARS patients who were treated in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan between April and May 2003 during the last epidemic of SARS in Taiwan, agreed to participate in this study. All the patients met the modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition of SARS [12]. SARS was confirmed by either positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays or elevated serum anti-coronavirus antibody by ELISA or both. Nasopharyngeal-aspirate samples were obtained from all study patients to exclude common viruses including influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial (RSV) virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2, and 3, using commercially-available immunofluorescence assays (IFA). Sputum and blood cultures were performed on all the cases to exclude bacterial or fungal infections. At 90 days, all the close contact relatives of the study SARS patients had their serum anti-coronavirus antibody measured by ELISA.
Nine non-smoking healthy volunteers (5 women and 4 men, aged 18 to 40 years) without evident current or past history of pulmonary diseases based on history as well as physical, chest radiographic and bronchoscopic examinations were selected as controls for this study. None of them had any upper respiratory tract infection within the last 6 weeks or was on antibiotics or other medications at the time of evaluation.
The study protocol was approved by Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Ethical Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all the subjects. Treatment of SARS patients on admission to our unit included broad spectrum antibiotics to target common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia, according to current recommendations [13,14]. These patients received variable therapy regimens, including oral ribavirin (1 g twice a day for 5–7 days), or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 1 g/kg body weight/day for 2 days), pulse steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 500 mg twice a day for 3 days and then prednisolone 1 mg/kg body weight/day for 5 days), or maintenance corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone 10 mg twice a day for more than 3 weeks). Pulse steroid therapy was administered within 3 days of the onset of fever in some patients, depending on the attending physicians' decision irrespective of severity of presentation. Some patients who did not receive pulse steroid therapy were given a short course of corticosteroid therapy (hydrocortisone 100 mg 3 times/day for 3 days) if there was rapid deterioration of pulmonary infiltration or hypoxemia. Maintenance steroid therapy (prednisolone 10 mg per day for one week) was given after pulse or short course corticosteroid therapy in all patients. Two patients were intubated with ventilator support because of hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Patients underwent HRCT and BAL on the 60th and 90th day after the onset of disease. HRCT was performed with 1- to 2-mm collimation sections reconstructed by the use of a high spatial frequency algorithm using a (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). The HRCT protocol consisted of thin sections obtained at 10-mm through the chest in a supine position without using intravenous contrast medium.
The HRCT findings, as previously described [9], were categorized the predominant pattern as: normal attenuation; ground glass opacification (hazy areas of increased attenuation without obscuration of the underlying vessels); consolidation (homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma with obscuration of the underlying vessels); reticular pattern; mixed pattern (combination of consolidation, ground glass opacities and reticular opacities in the presence of architectural distortion); ground-glass attenuation with traction bronchiolectasis or bronchiectasis; and honeycomb pattern. The extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed independently for each of three zones: upper (above the carina), middle (below carina up to the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein). Each lung zone (total of 6 lung zones) was assigned a score, modified from previously described [9], based on the following: 0 when no involvement, 1 when <25% involvement, 2 when 25 <50% involvement; 3 when 50% <75% involvement and 4 when 75% involvement. Summation of scores provided overall lung involvement (maximal CT score 24). The grading of the patient's chest radiograph and HRCT was the consensus of two observers who were blind to clinical information of the patients.
BAL was performed on all the study subjects using six aliquots (50 ml each) of 0.9% saline solution as described previously [15]. Briefly, sterile saline solution was introduced into the subsegmental bronchus of the most severely involved lobe. The BAL fluid was retrieved and centrifuged. The supernatant was stored at -70°C until analysis and the cell pellet was washed and resuspended at 106 cells per ml. The cell viability and differential cell counts were determined. Total RNA and DNA were extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates and cells retrieved by BAL with the Viral RNA minikit and QIAmp DNA minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR was done for influenza A, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and SARS-CoV as- described previously [16].
BAL cells were simultaneously stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (anti-IgG1, -IgG2a, -CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD19, -CD56) (Beckon Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol to identify the proportions of T lymphocytes, CD4, CD8 T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells subpopulations respectively. The relative ratio of CD4 or CD8 in CD3-positive cells was assayed by a dual-color analysis. Data were acquired and analyzed using Becton Dickinson BD LYSYS II and Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) software (San Jose, CA).
The levels of cytokines and chemokines in BAL fluid were assayed using Becton Dickinson (BD) Cytometric Bead Array™ [17] (CBA; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions with an antibody (PharMoingen, San Diego, CA) against one of five cytokines (Human Chemokine Kit I: CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL9/MIG, CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, BD Biosciences,) or of the six cytokines (Human Inflammation Kit: IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-12, BD Biosciences). Commercially available ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis) was used for measurement of the growth factors, TGF-β, IGF-1 and EGF.
We used a previously-described method for virus detection by electron microscopy [18]. Cells retrieved by BAL from SARS patients and normal subjects were centrifuged. The cell pellets were fixed, embedded and stained with 4% tannic acid and 0.5% uranyl acetate. The ultra-thin sections were cut from Epon-embedded blocks, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (H-500, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. The baseline characteristics, disease and laboratory variables between groups were compared using the two-tailed Student t-test and chi-square test, respectively. Spearman rank test was used to determine correlations between HRCT scores and T cell numbers, and their subpopulations, as well as CD4/CD8 ratio. Univariate analyses to determine the factors responsible for persistence of HRCT abnormalities were primarily used for selection of variables, based on a p value <0.05. The significant variables were entered into a stepwise logistic regression analysis to determine the net effect for each predictor while controlling of the others. A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Analysis was performed using SPSS software version 10.0 (Chicago, IL, USA).
28 patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS were admitted during the study period. Sixteen patients received intubation and ventilatory support for respiratory failure. Three died of intractable hypoxemic respiratory failure. Twenty-five patients recovered subsequently and were discharged from the hospital. No patient relapsed with either fever or new pulmonary infiltrates after discharge from the hospital. Twenty of the 25 patients were randomly selected into the protocol and twelve agreed to participate. These patients complied with the protocol at 60 days but at 90 days, only 10 of 12 patients agreed to have a repeat HRCT, and 6 of 12 patients had a follow-up bronchoscopy.
At 60 days, the commonest symptoms in SARS patients were general weakness (8 of 12 patients), exertional dyspnea (6 of 12 patients), joint pains (4 of 12 patients) and partial hair loss (11 of 12 patients). At 90 days, all the 12 SARS patients were well without any of the above-described symptoms. There was no detectable SARS-CoV antibody in the sera of close contact relatives of the study patients, even though SARS patients were not isolated after discharge from hospital from their close relatives.
At 60 days, 5 SARS patients were found with an HRCT abnormality of <10 % of the total lung field. In 3, the score was zero, in one ground glass attenuation was found in 7.5% of total lung field, and in another, there was consolidation in 1.7% of total lung field. The other 7 SARS patients had HRCT abnormality > 10% of each lung field (a mean of 37.5 ± 7.9% involvement of total lung field) (Table 1). The most prominent HRCT findings in these patients were ground-glass attenuation (80.8 ± 12.2% of total abnormality on HRCT) and consolidation (13.6 ± 10.9% of total abnormality on HRCT). Honeycombing and bronchiectatic changes were found in only 3 SARS patients with high HRCT score (5.5 ± 2.7% of total abnormality on HRCT). Seven of 11 patients were found normal on their follow-up HRCT at 90 days (Table 2; Figure 1). Two of the patients had persistently high HRCT scores (Table 1). One with very high HRCT score at 60 days refused a follow-up HRCT.
The residual abnormality on HRCT at 60 days was related to the clinical course. Univariate analysis identified 3 factors associated with the residual abnormality on HRCT. There were a greater proportion of patients receiving pulse steroid therapy (4 of 7) in patients with high HRCT score (Table 2). In contrast, none of the patients with low HRCT score received pulse steroid therapy (Table 2). There was no significant difference in other therapy, including maintenance or short course corticosteroid therapy, IVIG or ribavirin, between patients with high HRCT score and those with low HRCT score (Table 2). Patients with high HRCT score had significantly longer course of fever and higher serum SARS-CoV antibody titer when compared to those in patients with low HRCT score (Table 2).
At 60 days, compared to normal subjects, there was a significant increase in total cell counts in BAL fluid from SARS patients (Table 3) with a significant increase in alveolar macrophages (AM) and lymphocytes., The proportion of CD8+ T cells was increased to a greater extent than CD4+ T cells, leading to a significant decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio (Table 4). There was also a significant increase in the proportion of NK cells in SARS patients (Table 4). There was no significant difference in B lymphocytes between SARS patients with low or high HRCT scores and normal subjects. HRCT scores were highly correlated with the cell counts of total lymphocyte, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and inversely related to the CD4/CD8 ratio (Figure 2). At 90 days, the cellular profiles in BAL fluid of 6 SARS patients were significantly improved compared with those at 60 days, with near normalization (Tables 3, 4).
At 60 days, SARS patients had a significantly higher level of chemokines, IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES (Table 5), and of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. However, the growth factors, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), were not increased (Table 5).
The 12 enrolled patients had serological evidence of recent infection with the SARS-CoV and in seven, viral RNA was detected in samples taken from nasopharyngeal aspirate or stool. However, viral RNA was not detectable in the stool or nasopharyngeal aspirate of any of the SARS patients at 60 days. Healthy controls had no evidence of SARS-CoV antibody or RNA in the serum or the respiratory tract. There were no detectable common viruses including influenza viruses A and B, RSV virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2, and 3, using IFA for nasopharyngeal aspirates or using RT-PCR assay for cells retrieved by BAL at 60 or 90 days. Serological studies for Clamydia, Mycoplasma or Legionella were negative in all subjects.
At 60 days, EM examination of BAL fluid revealed many coronavirus-infected alveolar macrophages with intracellular viral particles in 7 of 12 patients (Figure 3; Table 1). These patients had the high HRCT scan scores. Coronavirus infected cells were not detected in any of SARS patients with low HRCT score or in normal subjects (Table 1). RT-PCR amplification of coronavirus nucleic acids was positive in 3 of 7 patients with high HRCT score, but in none of patients with low HRCT score or normal subjects. At 90 days, EM examination did not detect any coronavirus-infected cells in 6 SARS patients, in 5 of the 6, viral inclusions were found in AM at day 60 (Table 1). One patient with persistent high HRCT score (case 12) refused follow-up BAL study at 90 days.
This study was performed during the last epidemic of SARS in Taiwan, and the number of patients recruited has been limited. The epidemic did not recur during 2004, and there have been no further cases of SARS in Taiwan, such that we were not able to increase the number of patients in this study. Despite the relatively low numbers, our observations indicate that there are persistent important inflammatory and radiological abnormalities in some patients who have recovered from acute SARS at 60 days after the illness. These changes were those of ground-glass or/and consolidation abnormalities which may be overlooked on examination of plain chest radiographs. The BAL fluid examination performed for the first time in recovering SARS patients confirmed the presence of an on-going active inflammatory process in most patients with increased macrophages, NK cells and T cells, and augmented levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These inflammatory responses may be elicited by the persistent presence of coronavirus in alveolar macrophages, since the patients with the highest HRCT changes had coronaviruses present and there was no evidence of bacterial or other viral infection in these patients.
Most viral diseases are characterized by the development of a specific infiltration consisting predominantly of mononuclear leukocytes while neutrophils are absent [19]. The most striking features of alveolar inflammation in patients were increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, T lymphocytes and NK cells, with a striking decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio. The HRCT score was highly correlated with T lymphocyte numbers and their subpopulations, and was inversely related to CD4/CD8 ratio. CD8+ T cells may act as cytotoxic cells and are key effectors of virus clearance [20]. The concurrent increase in CD4+ T cells may promote the clonal expansion of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and is essential for maintaining continued CD8+ T cells surveillance and effector capacity [19].
Exposure of monocytes or macrophages to viruses causes the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6, and chemokines [20-22] as well as members of the CC-chemokine subfamily such as MIP-lα, MCP-1, and RANTES which preferentially attract monocytes and lymphocytes [22]. The CXC-chemokines, such as IL-8 or GRO-α, are major neutrophil chemoattractants [23]. MIG/CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 9 and IP-10/CXCL10, both inducible by interferon-γ, are ELR-negative CXC chemokines and are potent chemoattractants for mononuclear cells, specifically activated T lymphocytes and NK cells [24]. In this report, we demonstrated elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES and IL-8 in BAL fluid in SARS patients compared to those of normal subjects. Increased secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 may be derived from virus-infected macrophages or from CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, and these cytokines may promote T-lymphocyte extravasation and macrophage activation [19], but such processes may not be sufficient on their own to recruit and activate mononuclear cells in virus-infected lungs. The increased levels of MCP-1 and RANTES in BAL fluid of all SARS patients may be responsible for the generation of mononuclear infiltrates observed after coronavirus infection. IP-10 and MIG, whose levels are also increase in SARS patients, recruit monocytes and macrophages, NK cells and activated, but not resting T lymphocytes [25,26].
Although there were increased levels of IL-8 in BAL fluid in SARS patients, the number of neutrophils in BALF were sparse. The absence of neutrophil infiltration in influenza A virus or respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) infection is attributed to the suppression of neutrophil attracting CXC-chemokines or by induction of IL-10 [27]. However, IL-8 production can be induced by measles virus infection of fibroblasts [28] and by influenza A virus, RSV and rhinovirus in pulmonary epithelial cells or AM [28-31]. The reasons for the lack of neutrophil recruitment in response to elevated IL-8 levels in SARS patients are not known and this deserves further investigation.
Despite the presence of virus in AM at 60 days when patients had already been discharged from hospital, these patients were not infectious, because none of their close contact relatives developed any detectable SARS-CoV antibody in their sera. The HRCT and the clinical course until the 90th day of illness did not suggest any evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in SARS patients. This was in accord with the low level of cytokines and growth factors responsible for tissue repairing and fibrosis [32], such as IL-1β, TGF-β, IGF-1, and EGF detected in BAL fluid. However, evidence of fibrosis on HRCT has been obtained on HRCT scans particularly in patients with very severe disease during the acute phase of SARS [33].
The use of corticosteroids together with ribavirin has been reported to confer clinical benefit, although randomized clinical trials to support its clinical efficacy are not available. Pulse steroid therapy was reported to lead to less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood to require rescue pulse steroid therapy than their counterparts [34]. However, corticosteroids have been shown to increase mortality of pneumovirus-infected mice by accelerating replication of virus [35]. Pulse steroid therapy was also reported to be associated with residual abnormality on HRCT in SARS patients after discharge from hospital [10]. In the current retrospective, non-randomized series, pulse steroid therapy appeared to be associated with delayed resolution of pneumonitis. We have planned a prospective future study on investigating the effect of pulse steroid therapy in case of future outbreaks of SARS. This is because this issue is extremely important in outcome from SARS.
In conclusion, a proportion of recovered SARS patients have delayed resolution of pneumonitis and delayed clearance of coronavirus in the alveolar space at day 60. This was associated with persistent inflammatory response characterized by macrophages, T cells particularly CD8+ T cells, and NK cells, and by increase in cytokines and chemokines. This host inflammatory response against SARS-CoV infection may contribute to persistent HRCT abnormalities during recovery phase of SARS. On the other hand, we found no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in SARS patients during recovery. At day 90, many of the abnormalities have disappeared. Patients recovering from SARS need to be followed up for at least 3 months after the infection.

32. PREDBALB/c: a system for the prediction of peptide binding to H2d molecules, a haplotype of the BALB/c mouse
The T cells of the immune system recognize antigens as short peptide fragments (T-cell epitopes) derived from self or foreign proteins. Self proteins include all proteins produced by the cells of the host. Foreign peptides are derived from pathogens, environmental antigens, tumor cells and transplanted tissue. Immune recognition of both self and foreign antigens involves proteolytic processing of antigens, binding of the peptide epitopes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and presentation of selected peptide epitopes on the cell surface to activate of T cells (1–4). Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) recognize peptides bound to MHC class I molecules and helper T cells (CD4+) recognize antigen in the context of MHC class II molecules. MHC class I molecules are present in all cells and bind mainly endogenous peptides (those produced within the presenting cell), whereas class II molecules are present mainly in cells that recognize foreign proteins, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. T-cell epitopes are critical for the immune response to infectious, autoimmune, allergic and neoplastic disease. They have been studied for the development of peptide-based vaccines (5) and may also be important in the diagnosis of pathogens. It is estimated that between 1 and 5% of all peptides can bind a particular MHC molecule (6). Traditional approaches to the identification of T-cell epitopes that involve various biochemical and functional assays of overlapping peptides derived from proteins of interest are costly and not applicable to large-scale studies. Accurate predictions using computer models help speed up the identification of T-cell epitopes (7), minimize the number of experiments necessary and enable systematic scanning for candidate T-cell epitopes from larger sets of protein antigens, such as those encoded by complete viral genomes (8).
The BALB/c inbred laboratory mouse strain is one of the most commonly used animal models in immunological studies and has been used extensively in vaccine research (9,10). BALB/c mice express three class I (H2-Kd, H2-Ld and H2-Dd) and two class II (I-Ad and I-Ed) molecules. Several publicly available prediction systems for MHC class I and class II binding peptides provide the prediction models for (histocompatibility complex-2) H2d alleles. SYFPEITHI (11) has H2-Kd and H2-Ld models, BIMAS (12) has H2-Kd, H2-Dd and H2-Ld models, and RANKPEP (13) has models for all H2d molecules. SYFPEITHI uses binding motifs, whereas BIMAS and RANKPEP use binding matrices. These are general servers that contain prediction models for a range of MHC molecules in human and mouse, and several other mammalian organisms, but the accuracies of individual models have not been determined. On the other hand, quantitative matrices for H2-Kb, H2-Db, H2-Ld and H2-Kk (14,15) have been developed and validated.
PREDBALB/c is a computational system for the prediction of peptides binding to all five MHC molecules in BALB/c mice (H2d) class I (H2-Kd, H2-Ld and H2-Dd) and class II (I-Ad and I-Ed) that allows analysis of proteins for the presence of binding motifs to all five H2d molecules in parallel. We derived the initial quantitative matrices for PREDBALB/c using logarithmic equations based on the frequency of amino acids at specific positions within the training set of 9mer peptides as described previously (16). The initial matrices were refined by including information on the consensus (11) and other binding motifs, for example, H2-Kd binding peptides that have I, L or M at major anchor position p2 (17). The anchor positions (e.g. positions 2 and 9 in Kd binding peptides) were assigned higher weights than other positions. In addition, the prediction scores were inspected for all permissible amino acids at each of the anchor positions. All amino acids at the anchor positions other than the permissible ones were assigned low scores to exclude peptides with non-permissible amino acids from the list of predicted binders. The final binding scores were normalized to a scale of 1–9 and the final models were tested and validated rigorously. To our knowledge, PREDBALB/c is the first online server for the prediction of peptides binding to a complete set of MHC molecules in a model organism (H2d haplotype).
The training data containing binding and non-binding peptides were extracted from MHCPEP (18), MHCBN (19), SYFPEITHI (11), JenPep (20) and a set of non-binders (V. Brusic, unpublished data). The 9mer peptides were used for deriving H2d class I matrices because the majority of peptides that bind these molecules are 9 amino acids long (21). Although the majority of H2d class II binding peptides are 12–20 amino acids long, their binding cores are 9 amino acids long (22,23). An iterative elimination method starting from I-Ad and I-Ed motifs in SYFPEITHI (11) was used to identify the core 9mer regions from long peptides (K.N. Srinivasan, G.L. Zhang, A. Veeramani, J.T. August and V. Brusic, manuscript in preparation). The number of peptides in the training sets is shown in Table 1. No one method of predicting peptide–MHC binding consistently outperforms the rest and the most appropriate predictive model depends on the amount of data available in Ref. (16). In our previous work, an artificial neural network method and hidden Markov models were applied to the prediction of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) binding peptides (24,25), where more training data were available. Because relatively small training data sets are available for H2d, we adopted matrix models as the prediction method.
Five 9 × 20 matrices were built, one for each of the five H2d alleles, and 10-fold cross-validations were performed to test the accuracy of the prediction models. The results show that PREDBALB/c predicts peptides binding to I-Ed, I-Ad and H2-Kd with excellent accuracy [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, AROC ≥ 0.90], and to H2-Dd and H2-Ld with good accuracy (AROC ≥ 0.85). The models were also rigorously tested using experimentally known peptides from viral, prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins (14,26–29) and validated by in vivo studies using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) nucleocapsid and HIV GAG proteins. The H2d models accurately predicted 11 out of 12 ELISPOT positive regions from BALB/c mice splenocytes immunized with SARS nucleocapsid DNA vaccines (data not shown).
The web interface of PREDBALB/c uses a set of graphical user interface forms. The interface was built using a combination of Perl, CGI and C programs. PREDBALB/c has been implemented in a SunOS 5.9 UNIX environment.
Users have the option to predict peptides binding to all H2d molecules, H2d class I molecules, H2d class II molecules or a single H2d molecule. The default selection on the webpage is ‘all H2d’ molecules. To perform predictions using PREDBALB/c, the user must paste a protein sequence into a textbox and assign a name to the sequence. The sequence must contain between 9 and 2000 amino acids. If the prediction is run with an input sequence containing symbols other than the 20 amino acid codes (spaces and carriage returns are allowed) or the total sequence length is outside the 9–2000 amino acids range, an error message will be displayed. The input can be either a contiguous protein sequence or a list of peptides, one per line. The default selection on the webpage is ‘protein sequence’ (Figure 1A), which means the input sequence is treated as a contiguous protein sequence (carriage returns and line breaks will be ignored). The PREDBALB/c input processing program decomposes protein sequence (or the list of peptides) into a series of 9mer peptides overlapping by eight amino acids. Individual 9mer peptides are then submitted for prediction. Predicted binding scores for all 9mers are displayed in the result tables (Figure 1B). The 9mer binding scores are within the range 0–10; the higher the score, the higher the probability of the peptide being a binder. PREDBALB/c has the option to plot the binding scores of all the overlapping 9mer peptides as a graph, in which the x-axis represents the start position of a 9mer peptide and the y-axis represents the binding score of the 9mer peptide (Figure 1C). The user can sort the peptides by their binding scores and choose to view only predicted binders with binding scores above a certain threshold. To assess prediction accuracy, we used measures of sensitivity SE = TP/(TP + FN) and specificity SP = TN/(TN + FP) (TP: true positives; TN: true negatives; FP: false positives; FN: false negatives). The higher the value of SP, the lower is the value of SE, which results in lower number of both TPs and FPs. The lower the value of SP, the higher is the value of SE, which results in higher number of both TPs and FPs. Raw binding scores are mapped to a linear scale that corresponds to SP values, and therefore the prediction thresholds across different models have similar meaning. For example, when a user sets the threshold to 8, the specificity of the predictions to all five alleles is 0.8. The corresponding sensitivities of each model can be viewed at .
When users select the input sequence type to be ‘a list of peptide sequences’, the input sequences separated by carriage returns or line breaks are treated as different peptides (Figure 2A). All overlapping 9mers in each peptide are submitted for prediction. In the result tables, predicted binding scores are represented by the highest individual 9mer binding score within the input peptide. The predicted binding scores of individual 9mers in each peptide in the list are not shown (Figure 2B). To display the top-scoring 9mer peptides from each input peptide, the user can use the function ‘View binding peptides at threshold 9’ (Figure 2B). In the result page (Figure 2C), the 9mers with binding scores equal to or above the threshold of 9 are aligned with the input peptides. The predicted 9mers are displayed with the names of the H2d alleles to which the 9mer binding scores are above the threshold. For example, the first input peptide, YPILPEYLQCVK, has binding scores 9.10, 7.00, 5.74, 7.62 and 8.62 to H2-Dd, H2-Kd, H2-Ld, I-Ad and I-Ed, respectively (Figure 2B). At threshold 9 (SP level 0.9), there are no 9mer binders to H2d class II alleles and the 9mer ILPEYLQCV has the highest binding score to H2-Dd, 9.10. Thus, in Figure 2C, this 9mer is aligned with the input peptide and followed by ‘Dd’.
PREDBALB/c marks a new direction in predictive modeling of MHC-binding peptides and T-cell epitopes. The main advantage is that PREDBALB/c focuses on a complete organism and its predictions represent a complete set of predicted targets of T-cell immune responses. The focus on the complete set of MHC alleles is closer to studies involving laboratory animals. This approach provides a more complete view of the immune responses of an organism. The BALB/c mouse is an important laboratory model and PREDBALB/c is, therefore, useful for the analysis of immunization regimens and deciphering responses to infections. Further development of PREDBALB/c will include addition of matrices for prediction of 8mer and 10mer binders to H2d class I molecules and further improvement of prediction matrices by cyclical refinement—using newly defined binders and non-binders from experiments.

33. GENSTYLE: exploration and analysis of DNA sequences with genomic signature
A great number of DNA sequences are now available from web-based databases. DNA samples of >140 000 named organisms can be found, for example, in GenBank. The characteristics of these sequences have been extensively studied, and extracted information is often interpreted in terms of evolution or systematic molecular biology.
Many works are devoted to the so-called metagenomic analysis of DNA sequences. One approach deals with the frequencies of short oligonucleotides. Karlin and Burge initially focused on dinucleotide relative abundance (1). It quickly became obvious that the set of oligonucleotide frequencies was species specific (2–6). The set of oligonucleotide frequencies was subsequently considered to be a genomic signature.
Studies based on genomic signature are becoming more and more popular (7,8). It has been observed that the genomic signature results from a species-specific ‘writing STYLE’ (4,9,10). Indeed, on the one hand, the genomic signatures of species differ from one another, and, on the other hand, the majority of genome segments within a species have comparable signatures. As a consequence, each species can be assigned a DNA style that can be derived from most of its available DNA fragments.
The methodology that we have developed thus makes it possible to study and compare a great number of sequences and species, inasmuch as the calculation of a signature on a laptop computer requires <1 s per million nucleotides. The genomic signature is visualized as a parametric image using the ‘chaos game representation’ algorithm (3,5,8,11–14). Our experience with genomic signatures shows that the comparison of four-letter word signatures offers a good trade-off between accuracy of classification, usual size of DNA fragments and computer load (9,15). In our hands, comparison of signatures is achieved by means of the Euclidian metric in a space with 256 dimensions (there are 256 different 4-letter words). Of course, other methods for comparison of signatures are available. They often provide slightly different results [see Refs (4,8,16,17) for some other measures of dissimilarities].
It must be pointed out that comparisons of DNA style do not require homologous sequences and almost any DNA segment is eligible (4,9). In fact, the species-specific DNA style concept motivates and justifies most of the works dealing with the genomic signature, including, for example, assignment of genomic fragments (4,18), taxonomic/phylogenetic analyses (15,17,19) and detection of horizontal transfers (HTs) (20,21). Detection of HTs is a major application of the DNA style concept. Some of the abnormal patterns in a genome may be considered to result from HTs. Numerous methods relying on a gene's nucleotide or oligonucleotide composition for the detection of HTs are available (22–32). Among them, hidden Markov models (HMMs) and wavelet transforms are two of the efficient approaches in use for detecting and characterizing original motifs and patterns. Their performances have been subjected to extensive comparisons (20,21,31,32).
Many other applications are emerging, such as the characterization of unknown sequences, the quality control of sequencing and pre-processing for homologous sequences screening. A web service () has recently been made available for the comparison of tetranucleotide usage patterns in DNA sequences (33). It comes with pre-computed tetranucleotide usage patterns for 166 prokaryote chromosomes as a source for limited data mining.
GENSTYLE is grounded in the genomic signature paradigm. It offers three sets of tools for the characterization and classification of nucleotide sequences. Parts of GENSTYLE were made accessible to the bioinformatics community through our site () starting in 1999, after the publication of the seminal paper describing the concept and its usefulness (3). The current version results from a substantial redesign that developed into the GENSTYLE workspace. Three dedicated toolboxes have been implemented for collecting, selecting and processing sequences. The sequence analysis toolbox is made for
Identification of the origin of short DNA fragments. Any DNA sequence is eligible for searching for its origin. This feature is useful, for example, for the recognition of rare and/or slow growth organisms (sequences usually hard to characterize).Detection of ‘atypical’ areas in a genome, in particular the detection of HTs (and potential donors). The closest species (from the genomic signature point of view) of an atypical DNA segment give clues about the donor in the case of putative HTs (under implementation).Building of taxonomic and phylogenetic trees. Distance between signatures remains to been established as a reference for phylogenetic studies, but several recent and interesting results have shown its potentially great value (15,17). In particular, our current work with corona viruses is very promising with this respect.
There is a large genomic signature database behind GENSTYLE that greatly enhances its power and scope. The full set of GENBANK sequences, stored by species, is available for signature studies. The GENSTYLE companion genomic signature database handles ∼170 000 species and unspecified organisms (>2 000 000 DNA sequences). It is updated on a regular basis, using the bimonthly releases issued by GenBank.
GENSTYLE tools are available from within a user workspace. This makes it possible to work online on the whole set (or part of it) of GenBank nucleotide sequences belonging to one or several species. User's sequences can also be uploaded to work with. Tools for the exploration and analysis of signatures are straightforward. They do not require much prior knowledge. Results are displayed in specific windows with images, tables and charts. Most of the outputs can be downloaded for further processing. The user's workspace can be saved for later use.
There are three toolboxes in the GENSTYLE workspace:
Sequence collector toolbox. The sequence collector allows workspace to be loaded with sequences of interest. Sequences can be selected through the GENSTYLE companion database browser. The user's sequences (FASTA format, eventually grouped into a single text file, zipped or not) can be uploaded through the uploader.Sequence filters toolbox. Although many sequences can be uploaded to a given workspace, it may be interesting to work on selected subsets. Several tools are available for this task, including selection of DNA type and size of sequences.Sequence analysis toolbox. The tools of this toolbox operate on the selected sequences of the workspace. They allow
Visualization of sequence signatures.Detailed examination of signatures. If several sequences are analysed together, a distance matrix (Euclidean metric, Phylip format) is provided to build taxonomic/phylogenetic trees (8).Searching for species with similar DNA signatures in the GENSTYLE companion database.Observation of similarities (and differences) between signatures by principal components analysis (PCA) (34).
Online versions of additional tools already in use in our lab are currently under development. They include navigation along genomes by means of local signatures (for HT detection, for example), visualization of similarities between local signatures along several genomes and taxonomic trees.
A tutorial is available online. It demonstrates how the origin of a small DNA sequence can be looked for in the GENSTYLE companion database. Briefly, the sequence of interest has to be pasted into the appropriate field of the demonstrator tool (Figure 1A). The sequence signatures for oligonucleotides (words) 1–9 nt long are subsequently calculated, oligonucleotide counts are obtained (Figure 1A) and signatures are displayed (Figure 1B). Specific word counts and frequencies are available in popup windows (Figure 1C). Species with the closest signatures are then determined (Figure 1D). Distances to the sequence of interest are expressed in an arbitrary unit (AU). It can be seen that the sequence of interest belongs to the SARS Virus (d = 11) and that the closest species are PEDV and PTGV corona viruses. Although this procedure seems to mimic BLAST/FASTA functions, it is quite different in nature. Similarities between sequences can be observed even when they are not homologous. As a consequence, the origin of a sequence can be obtained once the DNA material characterizing the genomic signature of the species of origin is available (typically 2000 nt). Homologous DNA counterparts are not required in the database.

34. A Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome extranet: supporting local communication and information dissemination
An Extranet is a private network that uses the Internet to securely share information or operations with selected partners; it is accessible from any web browser. The literature describes the use and potential benefits of local area Extranets in hospitals,[1] physician offices,[2,3] and small managed health care organizations [4]. A current U.S. National Emergency Medical Extranet (NEME) is being constructed to support emergency medicine and public health [5]. Building on the Centre for Disease Control's (CDC) national communication infrastructure, the US has begun to develop their Extranet to manage local public health emergencies, and plans to expand it for communicable disease surveillance and control activities [6].
A systematic review of the use of information technology in the event of bioterrorism evaluated web-based communication systems that link public health officials with clinicians and the public [7]. Although such systems have not been tested in crisis situations, the review indicates that they can securely manage disease-reporting needs of local and state officials. The systems evaluated most were those communicating abnormal findings in electronic medical records between institutions and clinicians. Three communication systems had the capacity to support rapid reporting and dissemination of information related to naturally occurring and bioterrorist-related infectious disease, although they required the use of electronic medical records.
A provincial Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emergency was declared in Ontario on March 26, 2003. Two days later, a SARS Steering Committee was convened in Hamilton, Ontario, linking Public Health and Community Services (PHCS) with other partners (Table 1). Hamilton is located about 70 kilometers west of Toronto, which was the centre of the outbreak. Information management was critical during the crisis. Communication from the Ontario Provincial Operations Centre proceeded through email and fax to hospitals, long-term care facilities, health units, and the Ontario Medical Association. Simultaneously, information came from the World Health Organization (WHO), Health Canada, other health units and health care partners. The multi-source nature of the information made it difficult to manage and synthesize the most current, accurate information in a timely fashion. In addition, information impacting health units and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) might have reached only hospital staff. Directives changed often, necessitating version control measures to ensure that everyone was working from the most recent documents. This situation was difficult to manage with emails as updates were often sent daily and document file sizes were too large to send. A decision was made to develop a single, limited-access web-based system to manage constantly changing local and provincial SARS control information.
In response to demands from the steering committee for up-to-date information, the City of Hamilton's Public Health and Community Services (PHCS) and Information Technology (IT) Division developed and launched an Extranet on April 3, 2003. The Extranet was developed to support the SARS steering committee in disseminating to partners comprehensive information that was timely, current, accurate and relevant. The Extranet also supported the implementation of local strategies using a secure accessible and managed centralized access point. SARS steering committee members (N = 53) received a common ID and password to access the site. The site did not require users to connect through a Virtual Private Network (VPN), nor was there any validation of IP addresses to validate users. The Extranet, however, was viewed as a private network using the Internet to securely share information with partners. The security aspects made it an Extranet.
The secure site provided document distribution, version control of documents such as clinical guidelines and directives, and control of links to information for schools and workplaces. An email link was provided to access the health unit's web master. Because of the speed at which this site had to be developed, there was insufficient time for developing other interactive communication tools or tracking IP addresses. Ideally, participatory design principles, [8,9] would have been used to design the site, but there was no time to actively involve end users or track the costs to set up and maintain the site. Set-up and maintenance of the site was estimated to require one programmer (100 hours @ $40/hr), one Information Architect and Business/Technical Liaison (95 hours @ $50/hr), and one communicable disease expert (10 hours @ $75/hr) over the twelve weeks the Extranet was in use (total = $9,500).
The objectives of this research were to examine a) the use and perceptions of a local SARS Extranet, and b) its potential to support future public health information dissemination and communication with the local community.
The local university ethics review board approved the study. Participants included all 53 SARS Steering Committee members. The authors designed and tested a survey containing 13 forced-choice and 8 open-ended questions, which focused on perceptions on the Extranet and on other SARS information and communication sources. Both web-based and paper-based surveys were used to ease completion and simplify data collection as well as to increase the response rate.
User testing was conducted with the online version of the survey to identify problems with use, ensure survey comprehension, calculate average completion time (10–15 minutes), and identify if dynamic or technical functionality posed challenges. A three-member observation team tested the web survey with four PHCS employees who were familiar with the SARS Extranet and comfortable using the web. Instructions were given to each participant based on a think-aloud protocol, [10-14]. Participants were asked to complete the web survey, while observers took notes. Participants were instructed to think out loud, make statements, or ask questions as they made their way through the survey. They were informed that observers would not respond, but that observers would benefit from hearing their comments and watching their actions. Observers noted problems spoken and/or observed, which were later discussed in a debriefing session after each test. They participated in a final debriefing session to identify problems that occurred with more than one participant; this process provided direction for survey improvements. Several minor survey modifications were made prior to the launch. The online survey form was dynamic and, depending on how a respondent replied to one question, determined the next series of questions. Thus, changes identified through the think-aloud technique related to branching of questions (If yes, go here; If no, go there). No other significant issues were identified. The paper-based survey was also modified slightly to match the web version.
On July 3rd 2003, all steering committee members were sent an information email along with a letter of introduction, an invitation to participate, and a direct link to the online survey. One week later, a reminder email was sent to non-respondents; two weeks later, the paper-based survey and self-addressed stamped envelope was mailed. Quantitative data were entered into SPSS for analysis. Two researchers independently coded the open-ended questions. Consensus was reached with the entire research team whenever differences in coding existed.
Thirty-four respondents rated the usefulness (1-lowest to 5-highest) of communication strategies used during the outbreak (Table 2). Email, teleconferences, and face-to-face meetings were rated the highest. Among SARS web-based resources, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) (mean = 4.1), the Center for Disease Control (CDC) (mean = 4.0), and the World Health Organization (WHO) (mean = 4.0) sites were the most valued. The Hamilton SARS Extranet site was rated fifth among the web resources (mean = 3.4).
The site had 3478 hits, and 30 respondents (88.2%) visited the Extranet (Table 3). The home page received the average number of 37.4 hits per day, while clinical guidelines and directives (10.3) and SARS Steering Committee minutes (7.3) received the next-highest average number of hits per day. Twenty-eight of them rated the quality of the Extranet and reported frequency of use. Even though the Extranet was rated lower than some other SARS web sites, when participants were asked specifically about the Hamilton Extranet, they rated it high overall (Mean = 4.0; SD = 0.8) (1 – lowest to 5 – highest). Criteria included relevance (Mean = 4.4; SD = 0.7), comprehensiveness (Mean = 4.0; SD = 0.8) accuracy (Mean = 4.3; SD = 0.6), and timeliness (Mean = 3.9; SD = 0.9). Most respondents (63.3%; n = 19) who used the Extranet visited the site at least once every few days. There was a difference in visiting habit between those who rated the Extranet most favourably (mean value ≥ 4 out of five points) and others. Those rating it most favourably visited the site more often (not statistically significant using two-sided Fisher's exact test, P > 0.50) than the others.
Thirty participants were asked a forced-choice question about whether they visited the site and why they visited. Most commonly, users visited to obtain SARS Steering Committee minutes (63.3%), access "Hamilton medical advisories" (53.3%), and obtain the SARS Steering Committee contact list (53.3%) (Table 4). These results corroborate the number of actual hits per page, Table 3. Other reasons for visiting included getting access to provincial directives and links to other websites. Although the difference was only marginally significant (P = 0.063), those who rated the website most favorably cited more reasons for using it than did others.
Eighteen participants revealed that they shared information from the Extranet with others outside of the committee. The information they shared most often included provincial directives and local information such as Hamilton medical advisories and Steering Committee minutes (Table 5). The average number of hits per page corroborates this finding, as these resources were used the most (Table 4). Eight (22.8%) respondents reported sharing the website address, username and password with middle management and staff.
Open-ended questions were included to gain a better understanding of the barriers, strengths, limitations, and other features of a local Extranet. Most respondents indicated that they experienced no personal barriers to accessing the Extranet. However, a few respondents indicated that time to access the site and duplication of information sent through email and the Extranet were barriers. A concern was raised related to Extranet access: "Some folks had access/password who should not have access, and were following information not yet implemented or disseminated internally." One person indicated that access was expanded to others as the outbreak was prolonged.
Regarding the strengths of the system, many respondents indicated that they appreciated the ability to access current, timely and comprehensive information in one location. One respondent noted " [It was] very useful for staff to have info in one place, in early days of SARS where no other provincial web sites [were] set up to access information." Another participant noted that the Extranet was able to "dispel rumours [and] contained a broad scope of information in one locale."
Respondents identified no weaknesses of the Extranet; however, a few commented on the manpower and time needed to keep the site current as well as the reliance on IT staff to upload information in a timely fashion. A few also noted the redundancy of the site; for example, "Once the provincial site [was] up [there was] no need for the Extranet." One participant highlighted a problem with Internet access: " [The] web network went down on one occasion during [the] crisis and delayed [the] info getting out."
Respondents mentioned that using an electronic system for communication during an emergency was a good learning experience. Some noted areas for improvement: They wanted technical support to be available (help-desk) for participants who might have difficulties accessing the secure web site. They also identified a need for a system that can be activated immediately in future public health emergencies.
Thirty respondents identified features they would like to see on a future Extranet so as to enhance communication with the public health department. Of these, 19 (63.3%) wanted to use the Extranet as a mechanism to send private email to public health experts; 19 (63.3%) wanted to use it to share a database for surveillance of infectious diseases; 15 (50%) wanted to use it as a bulletin board communication system; 9 (30.0%) wanted online certificate courses on public health matters; and 1 (3.3%) wanted to use it as a mechanism for physicians to send immunization data. From the open-ended questions, eleven respondents mentioned that the Extranet could be used for communicable disease communication, surveillance and/or reporting, and two respondents believed that the Extranet could support preparedness for future public health emergencies.
Our results showed that participants preferred email, face-to-face meetings, or phone communication to any Internet communication strategy. This is not surprising, considering these strategies are more interactive than visiting a typical web site. Respondents indicated that they wanted future Extranets to support private email to experts as well as have a bulletin board for feature use, validating our conjecture that they would prefer more interactivity. Two-way communication features may be important features to consider in the creation of future Extranet solutions so as to enhance interactivity. Further research is needed to measure the perceived value and impact of interactive technologies. In addition to having synchronous communication modes, such as a discussion board or email link, web-conferencing and real-time online communication using text chat may provide more effective interactive web-based solutions.
We can speculate on the various reasons why email was a preferred method of communication compared with web sites. An administrator likely views the use of email as part of his or her daily routine activity, but does not view searching web sites as a routine. Information is automatically 'pushed' to users in email, whereas users need to actively seek information from an Internet site. Furthermore, a web site is typically less interactive than email, with which users can easily reply to senders. Although the Hamilton Extranet had an email link, it was not used. The Extranet was likely not perceived by users as a two-way communication tool but, rather, a place to find information.
The Hamilton Extranet was rated low relative to other SARS web sites. Perhaps this was because the newly developed Hamilton Extranet had not had a chance to establish its credibility compared with long-established sites such as those from the CDC, WHO and the provincial MoHLTC. Despite this finding, the majority rated the Hamilton Extranet high overall, considering its own merits. Possible reasons for this positive opinion may be extrapolated from the findings: Given the most common reasons for visiting the site, the Extranet was perceived as useful to support local information needs such as meeting minutes, and Hamilton directives. In addition, until the provincial SARS site was launched, the Hamilton Extranet was the only source of provincial information. Once the MOHLTC website was launched, redundancy with Extranet information was inevitable; our findings supported this view. Also, provincial MoHLTC staff may not have been interested in specific local issues.
Despite the Extranet's shortcomings, the findings generally support the view that access to both local and provincial information is needed; however, better planning, coordination and alignment of local and provincial web communication strategies are required. It is essential to clarify without delay where the responsibility for communication begins and ends among local, provincial and federal public health agencies during emergencies.
The development of a local Extranet must be viewed as an evolutionary process. SARS Extranet users were moving away from email and fax communication to rely more on the Internet. The Extranet was built quickly to meet immediate local needs during the SARS emergency without taking time to fully engage end-users in design. Governance structures are needed to set guidelines about the practice of sharing passwords. Health units are thus urged to work with their communities before the next emergency to create a secure password-protected Internet communication system. Through such partnerships, local communities will feel more ownership and familiarity with the communication infrastructure.
Two areas of concern for a future Extranet are the security of the site and privacy of information. Many users shared with others both the information and the user IDs and passwords. Had there been sensitive information on the Extranet, a risk of improper access or release of information would have existed. These issues can be dealt with by more stringent security policies and technological improvements to the Extranet.
Looking beyond SARS, respondents were asked to respond to potential future Extranet applications for public health: Communication on communicable disease was the most common response. Not surprisingly, this response reflects the needs of the SARS Steering Committee, which was responsible for infection control during the SARS emergency. An Extranet also has the potential to include activities such as surveillance and public health education. In addition, an Extranet for use during non-emergency situations may create a useful infrastructure to support local communication in future emergencies.
This study has some important limitations. The survey was conducted three months after the initial SARS outbreak, so participants may not have accurately recalled their use of the site. This uncertainty is further complicated by the wide variety of SARS sites. The lack of statistical significance may be a result of the small size of the respondents. Finally, because the Extranet was developed quickly, it was not possible to plan for a rigorous evaluation. Qualitative evaluation methods would have been useful to answer questions about why participants rated the Hamilton site lower than other sites. Given more time for planning, set-up, and design of the Extranet, long-and short-term objectives would have been developed from which to frame a program evaluation. A more accurate system for tracking individual use would also have been incorporated. Better assessment of the human and financial costs of running the Extranet would have been a useful measure against the perceived value of the Extranet.
In conclusion, our study showed that interactive communication strategies – email, face-to-face meetings and teleconferences – were preferred over static web sites during the SARS outbreak. This finding has important implications for the future development and evaluation of web-based communication solutions. It is likely that more interactivity in web-based communication solutions would enhance their use and value. Although the CDC, WHO, and federal and provincial sources of SARS health information on the Internet were rated higher than that on the Hamilton Extranet, a local area Extranet appears to have an important role in supporting local information sharing and communication in an emergency situation. There is a need, however, for anticipatory planning, coordination and development of an Extranet communication system to ensure we are prepared for the next public health emergency. In addition, the findings indicate that users envisioned an expanded role of a local Extranet to support public health communication and education beyond the management of emergencies. Lessons learned from this study provide a foundation on which to build for future emergencies.

35. A universal BMV-based RNA recombination system—how to search for general rules in RNA recombination
RNA recombination is a very common phenomenon. It has been observed in all types of viruses using RNA as a carrier of genetic information: in positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (1–4), in negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (5,6), in double-stranded RNA viruses (7,8) and in retroviruses (9–11). Moreover, it has been shown that RNA recombination enables the exchange of genetic material not only between the same or similar viruses but also between distinctly different viruses (12). Sometimes it also permits crossovers between viral and host RNA (13–17). Taking into account the structure of viral genomic molecules and the location of crossover sites, three basic types of RNA recombination were distinguished: homologous, aberrant homologous and non-homologous (3,4,18). The former two occur between two identical or similar RNAs (or between molecules displaying local homology), while the latter involves two different molecules. Most of the collected data suggest that RNA recombinants are formed according to a copy choice model (4,18). A viral replication complex starts nascent RNA strand synthesis on one template, called RNA donor and then switches to another template, called RNA acceptor. Accordingly, two main factors are thought to affect RNA recombination: the structure of recombining molecules and the ability of the viral replicase to switch templates.
To gain more knowledge of the mechanism of RNA recombination, several model experimental systems have been created. They provided us with some specific data describing homologous and/or non-homologous recombination in particular viruses, e.g. in poliovirus, (19) mouse hepatitis virus (20,21), brome mosaic virus (BMV) (4,22), turnip crinkle virus (23,24) or tomato bushy stunt virus (25). As a result, the involvement of viral replicase proteins in recombination has been demonstrated (26,27) and a wide spectrum of RNA motifs supporting recombination have been identified (4,23,28–30). In general, the collected data suggest that there exist two major types of RNA structural elements that induce recombination events: (i) universal ones mediating template switching by different viral replicases, e.g. regions of local homology (28,31) or complementarity (32–35) and (ii) virus-specific ones, e.g. promoter-like structures (36,37). Unfortunately, up till now there has been no in vivo recombination system that could be used to test the recombination activity of any given RNA sequence and consequently to verify the above hypothesis and find some general laws governing the studied process.
In our studies on genetic RNA recombination we have used the well-characterized in vivo system developed in BMV (30,33). BMV is a model (+)RNA virus of plants (38). Its genome is composed of three segments called RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3. RNA1 and RNA2 encode BMV replicase proteins 1a and 2a, respectively. RNA3 encodes movement (3a) and coat proteins (CP) (38). All three BMV RNAs possess an almost identical 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). The first BMV-based recombination system was created by Nagy and Bujarski (33). They constructed a recombinationally active BMV mutant whose genome is composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and modified RNA3 (PN0-RNA3 called the recombination vector, for details see Figure 1). Only 3′-UTR was modified in PN0-RNA3, while its 5′-UTR, intergenic and coding regions were unchanged. Despite the introduced changes, the recombination vector is stable and replicates when used together with wtRNA1 and wtRNA2 to infect plants. It starts to recombine if a recombinationally active sequence (RAS) is introduced just between the CP coding sequence and the modified 3′ region (into the RAS-cloning site). Non-homologous recombination was observed when a 140–60 nt sequence complementary to RNA1 between positions 2856 and 2992 was inserted into PN0-RNA3 (a sequence from the 3′-portion of RNA1 was introduced in antisense orientation) (30,33). Interestingly, the same RNA1 fragment inserted in sense orientation did not support homologous crossovers (33). Non-homologous recombination repaired the RNA3 vector by replacing its highly modified 3′ end with 3′-UTR derived from RNA1. The resultant recombinants replicated and accumulated better than the parental RNA3 molecule, and so the latter was out competed from the infected cells. The above system is extremely efficient, since it employs selection pressure to support the accumulation of RNA3 recombinants. Because RAS is placed in two different segments of the BMV genome, we have proposed to name this system heteromolecular.
Unfortunately, Nagy and Bujarski's BMV-based recombination system has one serious limitation. It was designed in such a manner that viable RNA3 recombinants can easily form only if a sequence derived from the 3′-portion of RNA1 or RNA2 is used as a RAS. Consequently, the heteromolecular system could not be applied for testing the recombination capacity of various RNA motifs. Olsthoorn et al. (39) attempted to solve that problem by inserting examined sequences into the 3′-noncoding region of BMV RNA2 and RNA3. This system was not further developed, since any changes in RNA2, which encodes BMV polymerase, could strongly affect the studied process.
Here, we describe a new BMV-based recombination system. It has been constructed in such a way that both tested RASes are placed in the same segment of the BMV genome (in the modified RNA3 molecule); therefore, we have called this system homomolecular. To prove the usefulness of the homomolecular system, we have employed it to examine the recombination activity of sequences derived from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome. The examined sequences have been inserted into RNA3 as direct or inverted repeats. This demonstrated that the 101 nt hypervariable region of HCV efficiently supports both homologous and non-homologous crossovers, while the most conservative 98 nt portion of HCV's 3′-UTR induces only non-homologous recombination events. Moreover, a direct comparison of the hetero- and homomolecular systems revealed crucial differences between the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination. The former involves preferentially two different segments of the BMV genome and the latter occurs more easily between the same genomic RNAs.
Plasmids pB1TP3, pB2TP5 and pPN0-RNA3 containing full-length cDNA of BMV RNA1, RNA2 and modified RNA3 (recombination vector), respectively, were the generous gift from J. J. Bujarski (Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL).
Restriction enzymes (EcoRI, SpeI and XbaI) T7 RNA polymerase, RNasine, RQ DNase RNase free, MMLV-reverse transcriptase, Taq polymerase and pUC19 cloning vector were from Promega.
The following primers were used for the construction of pMatNH- pMatH-, pMatNH-HVR-, pMatH-HVR-, pMatNH-X-, pMatH-X-RNA3: (i) 5′-AAGGTACCCATGAGGAGTACTGTTTGGTTGCC-3′; (ii) 5′-AAGAATTCTGGTCTCTTTTAGAGATTACAG-3′; (iii) 5′-AAGGTACCACGCG TGGATCCGATATCATCTTTAATTGTGTTAAGTGATGCGC-3′; (iv) 5′-AATCTAGAC GTTGACGGGGGAACCTATTGT-3′; (v) 5′-AATCTAGAAAGCTGGATTTTCTGGGAT GACCC-3′; (vi) 5′-ATTCTAGATTTCCTTTTCTTTCCTTTGGTGGCTCCATCTTAG-3′; (vii) 5′-AATCTAGAACTTGATCTGCAGAGAGGCC-3′; (viii) 5′-ATACGCGTTTTCCTTTTCT TTCCTTTGGTGGCTC-3′; (ix) 5′-AAGATATCACTTGATCTGCAGAGAGGCC-3′; (x) 5′-AAACGCGTCGTTGACGGGGGAACCTATGTG-3′; (xi) 5′-AAGATATCAAGCTGG ATTTTCTGGGATGACCC-3′. The following primers were used for a specific RT–PCR amplification of the 3′-portion of BMV RNA3 (the region where recombinant junction sites are located): primer A—first strand primer complementary to the 3′ end of all BMV genomic RNAs and introducing the EcoRI restriction site, 5′-CAGTGAATTCTGGTCTCTTTTAGAGATTTACAAG-3′; primer B—second strand primer specific for RNA3, representing RNA3 sequence between positions 1726 and 1751.
Plasmids pMag1- and pMagH-RNA3 contain full-length cDNA of the RNA3 vector carrying the recombinationally active sequence RAS1 inserted in antisense or sense orientation, respectively. Both plasmids were constructed in the same way: pPN0-RNA3 was linearized with SpeI endonuclease and ligated with SpeI cut RAS1 cDNA. Then plasmids carrying RAS1 in antisense (pMag1-RNA3) and sense (pMagH-RNA3) orientation were identified (30).
To prepare pMatNH-RNA3 and pMatH-RNA3 plasmids (containing full-length cDNA of MatNH-RNA3 and MatH-RNA3), pMag1-RNA3 and pMagH-RNA3 were digested with KpnI and EcoRI endonucleases. Then, the deleted fragment was replaced with a KpnI–EcoRI cut 379 nt cDNA fragment corresponding to the BMV RNA1 3′ end (containing the entire 3′-UTR and RAS1). The latter were obtained by PCR involving primers 1, 2 and pB1TP3 as a template.
To construct pMat0-RNA3, i.e. a plasmid containing cDNA of the universal recombination vector Mat0-RNA3, the following modifications were introduced into pMatNH-RNA3. First, it was digested with SpeI endonuclease and religated. This way 5′RAS1as was removed and the 5′RAS cloning site (including only one restriction site SpeI) was created. Next, the plasmid was cut with KpnI and EcoRI to remove RNA1 3′-UTR and 3′RAS1s. Instead, a 295 nt fragment of RNA1 3′ end (between positions 2940 and 3234) followed by the 3′RAS cloning site (including KpnI, MluI, BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites) was ligated into pMatNH-RNA3. The inserted sequence was obtained by PCR using primers 2, 3 and pB1TP3 as a template and digested with KpnI and EcoRI, prior to ligation.
To test the recombination activity of HCV-derived sequences (hypervariable region 1, abbreviated HVR and sequence X, abbreviated X) cDNA of the corresponding fragments of the virus' genome was obtained by RT–PCR method (40,41) and cloned into the pUC19 vector. Then, both tested sequences were amplified by PCR with primers introducing an SpeI restriction site. Primers 4, 5 and primers 6, 7 were used to obtain HVR and X cDNA, respectively. PCR products and pMat0-RNA3 were digested with SpeI and ligated. Then pMat0-RNA3 derivatives bearing HVR and X in sense and antisense orientation were identified. HVR and X were amplified again by PCR involving primers introducing MluI and EcoRV restriction sites (primers 8, 9 and 10, 11 to amplify HVR and X, respectively). PCR products were cut with MluI and EcoRV and ligated into the 5′RAS cloning site of previously identified pMat0-RNA3 derivatives (carrying HVR and X in sense and antisense orientation). As a result four plasmids were obtained: (i) pMatH-HVR-RNA3—containing cDNA of MatH-HVR-RNA3 in which two HVRs were inserted in sense orientation; (ii) pMatNH-HVR-RNA3—containing cDNA of MatNH-HVR-RNA3 possessing two HVRs, 5′HVR in antisense and 3′HVR in sense orientation; (iii) pMatH-X-RNA3—containing cDNA of MatH-X-RNA3 in which two Xes are in sense orientation; (iv) pMatNH-X-RNA3—containing cDNA of MatNH-X-RNA3 carrying two Xes, 5′X in sense and 3′X in antisense orientation. Their structure was confirmed by sequencing.
To test the recombination activity of the BMV mutants, the previously described procedure was applied (30,33). Infectious BMV genomic RNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription for which EcoRI linearized plasmids pB1TP3, pB2TP5, pMag1-RNA3, pMagH-RNA3, pMatNH-RNA3, pMatH-RNA3, pMat0-RNA3, pMatH-HVR-RNA3, pMatH-HVR-RNA3, pMatHN-X-RNA3 and pMatH-X-RNA3 were used. Five-leaf C.quinoa plants (local lesion host for BMV) were mechanically inoculated with mixtures containing BMV RNA1, RNA2 and one of the RNA3 derivatives. Two weeks post-inoculation, the number of lesions developed on each inoculated leaf was counted to establish the infectivity of the tested BMV mutant. Then, individual local lesions were excised and total RNA was extracted separately from every lesion. The isolated RNA was subjected to RT–PCR involving primer A (the first strand primer) and primer B (the second strand primer) specific for RNA3 3′ fragment amplification (the region where recombination crossovers occur). As a control identical reactions involving either parental RNA3 transcript (positive control) or water (negative control) were carried out. RT–PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. The formation of 800 nt or shorter ∼500 nt products indicated that parental or recombinant RNA3 accumulated in the analyzed lesion, respectively. Next, RT–PCR products were cloned into the pUC19 vector and sequenced to determine the location of recombinant junction sites. Finally, the presence of recombinants in the selected local lesions was additionally confirmed by northern blot analysis.
The main question that we had to answer during our studies was how to design a vector that could be used for examining the recombination activity of any RNA sequences in vivo. As a result, the idea arose to construct a BMV-based homomolecular recombination system. In such a system, both tested sequences are supposed to be present within the same segment of the BMV genome (either in RNA1, RNA2 or RNA3). Thus, a new vector should possess two separately located RAS cloning sites, be replicable and stable during infection. It has to be capable of generating viable recombinants, which have selective advantage over parental RNA molecules. Consequently, recombinants ought to be able to out compete the vector with inserted RASes. Assuming that RNA recombination occurs according to a copy choice mechanism, we decided that RNA3, being dispensable for BMV replication, is the best candidate for a new vector. Any changes in RNA1 and RNA2, which encode BMV replicase proteins, would strongly affect the studied process. The next important question was whether the location of RASes within the same (homomolecular system) or within two different segments of the BMV genome (heteromolecular system) influences the recombination activity of the examined RNA sequence.
To address both issues, we decided to construct a so-called mixed system, homo- and heteromolecular at the same time. To this end two RNA3 molecules, prototypes of a new vector carrying two RASes, were prepared. To obtain them we used PN0-RNA3, described earlier, and a well-characterized recombinationally active sequence from BMV RNA1 (RAS1, see Figure 1). The 137 nt RAS1 corresponding to RNA1 between positions 2856 and 2992 was inserted into the PN0-RNA3 RAS cloning site, in antisense (RAS1as) and sense (RAS1s) orientations (Figure 2). As a result, we obtained Mag1- and MagH-RNA3 derivatives (30). Then the 356 nt portion of Mag1- and MagH-RNA3 3′ end was replaced with a 379 nt sequence representing the wtRNA1 3′ end (fragment encompassing the entire 3′-UTR and RAS1s sequence) (Figure 2). In addition, a marker mutation (called ΔXho) was introduced within the RNA1-derived fragment to make it distinguishable from an analogous region present in wtRNA1. To this end, the XhoI restriction site (2988–2994) was disrupted by a 4 nt insertion (GATC) between C-2991 and G-2992. Resultant RNA3 derivatives, called MatNH- and MatH-RNA3, have unchanged 5′-UTR, intergenic and coding regions and a highly modified 3′-UTR. The latter includes 3′-UTR coming from wtRNA1 and two RAS1 sequences (3′RAS1 and 5′RAS1) separated by a 338 nt spacer (sequence CCMV and B1). In MatNH-RNA3, 3′RAS1 is located in sense and 5′RAS1 in antisense orientation, while in MatH-RNA3 both RAS1 sequences are in sense orientation (Figure 2).
Having these two RNA3 derivatives, we were able to construct two variants of the mixed system: one for homologous (MatH-BMV mutant) and the other for non-homologous (MatNH-BMV mutant) recombination studies. The MatH-BMV genome is composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and MatH-RNA3 and the MatNH-BMV genome of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and MatNH-RNA3 (Table 1). In genomes of both BMV mutants three copies of RAS1 are present: two in the RNA3 derivative (RAS1s-RAS1s or RAS1as-RAS1s in MatH- and MatNH-RNA3, respectively) and one in wtRNA1 (RAS1s). Thus, in the mixed systems two identical RASes or RAS and its complementary counterpart were capable of supporting, respectively, homologous or non-homologous (heteroduplex-mediated) recombination between the same or between different BMV genomic RNAs. As a result, we could directly compare homo- and heteromolecular recombination systems in one in vivo experiment and examine whether our presumptions concerning the new recombination vector are correct.
Earlier, Nagy and Bujarski (33) demonstrated that the 66 nt portion of RAS1 did not support homologous recombination in heteromolecular system. We repeated this experiment using MH-BMV mutants. Recombinants also did not form although the entire RAS1 sequence was present in wtRNA1 and MagH-RNA3 molecules (Table 1 and Figure 3). To test RAS1 activity in the mixed homologous recombination system, a previously used, well-established procedure was applied (30,33). C.quinoa plants (local lesion host for BMV) were inoculated with a mixture containing in vitro transcribed wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and MatH-RNA3. After 2 weeks, when infection symptoms were well developed, the number of lesions formed on every inoculated leaf was counted to determine the infectivity of the MatH-BMV mutant. Individual local lesions were excised and total RNA was extracted separately from each of them. Then, the 3′-portion of RNA3 progeny accumulating in examined lesions was selectively amplified by RT–PCR involving RNA3 specific primers A and B (for their location see Figure 1). Reaction products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel and their length was determined. The formation of an ∼800 or 400–500 nt DNA fragment indicated that the lesion contained parental or recombinant RNA3, respectively. In this way, we were able to determine the number of lesions in which a viable RNA3 recombinant was generated. The presence of recombinants in analyzed lesions was confirmed by standard northern blot hybridization. DNA fragments obtained during selective RT–PCR amplification of RNA3 were cloned and sequenced. Finally, the results obtained with our new mixed homologous recombination system were compared with analogous data previously got using the heteromolecular system (33) (see Table 1 and Figure 3).
The data presented in Table 1 indicate that the exchange of MagH-RNA3 (carrying a single RAS1) into MatH-RNA3 (bearing two RAS1 sequences) did not affect the infectivity of the BMV mutants. The average numbers of lesions appearing on the leaves inoculated with MH- and MatH-BMV were similar: 18 and 17, respectively. Interestingly, although RAS1 did not support homologous crossovers in the heteromolecular system represented by MH-BMV, it was very active in the mixed system. About 85% of the local lesions developed during MatH-BMV infection accumulated the RNA3 recombinant instead of parental MatH-RNA3. In all of them, one RAS1 and a spacer were deleted. This indicates that crossovers occurred either within 3′ end 5′RAS1 present in MatH-RNA3 (inter- or intramolecular crossovers) or within RAS1 and 5′RAS1 located in wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3, respectively. Recombinant junction sites were placed in identical regions; therefore, their location could not be precisely established.
The data presented till now also could not answer which molecules, exclusively MatH-RNA3 or wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3, participated in recombination. In the heteromolecular system, only RAS1-mediated crossovers between wtRNA1 and MagH-RNA3 were permitted. The situation seems to be more complicated in the mixed homologous system where three copies of RAS1 are present, all in sense orientation: two of them in MatH-RNA3 (3′RAS1 and 5′RAS1) and one in wtRNA1. Consequently, RAS1-mediated homologous recombination may happen according to four different scenarios (Figure 3). It can engage MatH-RNA3 only and occur as intra- or intermolecular process or it can involve wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3. In the latter case, recombination can be mediated by RAS1 present in wtRNA1 and either 5′- or 3′RAS1 located in MatH-RNA3.
To learn according to which scenario homologous recombination occurred, we checked whether mutation ΔXho introduced into MatH-RNA3 (just behind 3′RAS1) is still present in RNA3 recombinants. In this way, we were able to determine if their 3′-UTR was derived from MatH-RNA3 or wtRNA1 molecules. The undertaken analysis revealed that the mutation was present in ∼20% of recombinants. This result suggested that homologous crossovers preferentially occur between wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3.
However, there are other explanations why ΔXho was absent in a large fraction of recombinants. It is possible that the mutation was removed either from MatH-RNA3, due to homologous recombination between its 3′RAS1 and wtRNA1, or from the RNA3 recombinant (carrying a single copy of RAS1) because it could also have recombined with wtRNA1. To examine the first possibility, progeny RNA3 extracted from the local lesions accumulating MatH-RNA3 (lesions in which recombinant was not generated) was analyzed. About 800 nt RT–PCR products obtained during selective amplification of RNA3's 3′-portion were cloned and sequenced. In all of 20 analyzed clones ΔXho was present. To test the second possibility, a full-length cDNA clone of RNA3 recombinant containing ΔXho (RNA3-ΔXhoR) was obtained. It was inserted into the pUC19 vector under the T7 polymerase promoter. The resultant plasmid named pRNA3-ΔXhoR was used after linearization to produce an infectious RNA3-ΔXhoR molecule by in vitro transcription. Then, RNA3-ΔXhoR was used together with wtRNA1 and wtRNA2 to inoculate C.quinoa plants. After 2 weeks, total RNA was extracted from individual lesions and a 3′-portion of the progeny RNA3 was amplified by RT–PCR. Obtained products were cloned and sequenced. As described previously, ΔXho was present in all of the analyzed 20 clones. These two experiments proved that homologous recombination between either 3′RAS1 of MatH-RNA3 or RAS1 present in RNA3 recombinant and wtRNA1 does not occur frequently enough to explain why most recombinants lack ΔXho. Altogether, these results supported our initial thesis that ΔXho was removed from 80% of homologous recombinants, since most of the crossovers occurred within 5′RAS1 from MatH-RNA3 and RAS1 from wtRNA1.
Earlier we showed that RAS1 can effectively support non-homologous recombination if inserted into PN0-RNA3 in antisense orientation (30,33). The heteromolecular system used in our experiment was composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and Mag1-RNA3 (M1-BMV mutant). Crossovers occurred within the local double-stranded region (local heteroduplex), which wtRNA1 and Mag1-RNA3 were capable of forming. In order to test RAS1 activity in the mixed non-homologous recombination system, C.quinoa plants were inoculated with the MatNH-BMV mutant (its genome is composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and MatNH-RNA3). Two weeks later progeny RNA3 were analyzed as described above. The number of lesions developed on each leaf was counted and total RNA was extracted from individual local lesions. After RT–PCR amplification, the 3′-portion of BMV RNA3 accumulating in each lesion was analyzed in an agarose gel, cloned and sequenced. The presence of recombinants was confirmed by a standard Northern blot. The results obtained were compared with analogous data we had got using the heteromolecular system (30) (Table 1 and Figure 4).
As described previously, we observed that the exchange of Mag1-RNA3 (with a single RAS1as sequence) for MatNH-RNA3 (with two sequences: RAS1as and RAS1s) did not influence the infectivity of the BMV mutants. The average numbers of lesions developed on each leaf during infection with M1-BMV and MatNH-BMV were 19 and 18, respectively. There was also no difference between the recombination activity of M1-BMV and MatNH-BMV. RAS-1 (in fact RAS1s and RAS1as) supported non-homologous recombination equally in both systems. Recombination events occurred with a similar frequency (100 and 95% for M1- and MatNH-BMV, respectively) and recombinant junction sites were located within the same region of the heteroduplexes, which recombining molecules were capable of forming.
In the heteromolecular system, only one type of heteroduplex supporting non-homologous crossovers could possibly form: between wtRNA1 and Mag1-RNA3. In the mixed system, recombining molecules were capable of forming three types of heteroduplexes: (i) intermolecular, between 5′RAS1as from MatNH-RNA3 and RAS1s from wtRNA1, (ii) intermolecular, between 5′RAS1as and 3′RAS1s located in two MatHN-RNA3 molecules and (iii) intramolecular, between 5′RAS1as and 3′RAS1s located in the same MatNH-RNA3 molecule (Figure 4). To determine the molecules that participated in non-homologous recombination, the RT–PCR amplified 3′-portions of RNA3 were checked for ΔXho. It was present in 90% of recombinants. This result clearly showed that non-homologous crossovers almost always involve one (intramolecular recombination) or two (intermolecular recombination) MatNH-RNA3 molecules.
The results presented above indicated that the homomolecular system can provide new interesting data concerning the mechanism of RNA recombination, especially if it could be used for testing the recombination activity of RNA sequences derived from other RNA-based viruses. Consequently, we attempted to construct a universal BMV RNA3-based recombination vector called Mat0-RNA3 (for details see Materials and Methods and Figure 5A). In Mat0-RNA3, as in the former PN0-RNA3 vector, only 3′-UTR was modified. It is composed of the 295 nt very 3′ end of RNA1 followed by the 3′ RAS cloning site, a 338 nt spacer and the 5′ RAS cloning site.
To determine the infectivity and stability of the new vector, C.quinoa plants were inoculated with a mixture containing wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and Mat0-RNA3 (Mat0-BMV mutant). After 2 weeks, the number of lesions developed on inoculated leaves was counted and then standard analysis of progeny RNA was carried out. Twenty separate lesions were excised, the total RNA was isolated and used for the selective RT–PCR amplification of the 3′-portion of progeny RNA3. The length of RT–PCR products was established by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. In addition, reaction products were cloned and sequenced. This demonstrated that the Mat0-BMV mutant is infectious (usually 20 lesions were developed on each leaf, see Table 2) and Mat0-RNA3 is stable during the whole period of infection and thus it can be used as a recombination vector.
In order to demonstrate that Mat0-RNA3 can be used as an effective tool in recombination studies, we applied it to examine the recombination activity of two specific sequences derived from the HCV genome. The first, 101 nt sequence is placed within the 5′-portion of the HCV genome (within the fragment encoding E2 protein) and is named HVR (40,42). The second, called the sequence X (X) constitutes a 98 nt 3′ end of HCV genomic RNA. It has been shown that X represents the most conservative fragment of HCV genome (43). Both sequences were obtained by a standard RT–PCR method involving viral RNA isolated from the blood of infected patients as a template (40,41). Amplified fragments were inserted into the 5′-cloning site of Mat0-RNA3 in two different orientations (sense and antisense), then only in sense orientation into the 3′-cloning site (for details see Materials and Methods). As a result, four different Mat0-RNA3 derivatives were generated: (i) MatH-HVR-RNA3, possessing two copies of HVR in sense orientation (3′ and 5′HVRs); (ii) MatH-X-RNA3, with two copies of X in sense orientation (3′ and 5′Xs); (iii) MatNH-HVR-RNA3, with two copies of HVR, the 3′-copy in sense and the 5′ in antisense orientation (3′HVRs and 5′HVRas); (iv) MatNH-X-RNA3, with two copies of X located in different orientation (3′Xs and 5′Xas) (Figure 5B). The former two were applied to test HVR's and X's ability to support homologous crossovers while the latter two to examine Xs/Xas' and HVRs/HVRas' capacity to induce non-homologous, heteroduplex-mediated recombination. Unlike previously tested mutants (MatNH- and MatH-BMV), in MatH-HVR-, MatNH-HVR-, MatH-X- and MatNH-X-BMV, the examined sequences were present only in the recombination vector. They were absent in the two other genomic RNAs, so that recombination crossovers could involve only RNA3 molecules.
To determine the recombination activity of HCV-derived sequences, C.quinoa plants were inoculated with four BMV mutants: MatH-HVR-BMV, MatNH-HVR-BMV, MatH-X-BMV and MatNH-X-BMV. Their genomes were composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and one of the newly generated Mat0-RNA3 derivatives (either MatH-HVR-, MatNH-HVR-, MatH-X- or MatNH-X-RNA3) (Table 2). After 2 weeks, the standard procedure of BMV RNA3 progeny analysis was applied. The number of lesions developed during each infection was counted. The 3′-portion of progeny RNA3 was amplified by the RT–PCR method. The length of RT–PCR products was established (by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel), then they were cloned and sequenced.
We found that BMV mutants carrying HVRs/HVRs and HVRs/HVRas sequences are as infectious as Mat0-BMV; usually they developed 14–18 lesions on each inoculated leaf. The two others, MatH-X- and MatNH-X-BMV mutants, are visibly less infectious and developed 3–5 and 4–8 lesions/leaf, respectively. Despite differences in their infectivity, BMV mutants carrying 3′HVRs and 5′HVRas as well as 3′Xs and 5′Xas supported non-homologous, heteroduplex-mediated crossovers very efficiently. An RNA3 recombinant was generated in 100 and 90% of lesions developed during infection with MatNH-HVR- and MatNH-X-BMV, respectively. Recombinant junction sites were located within the left portion of the local double-stranded region that could potentially be formed either by HVRs and HVRas or by Xs and Xas. As a result, both sequences supporting non-homologous crossovers were almost entirely deleted, together with the whole spacer (Figure 5D and E).
Interestingly, homologous recombinants were generated only during infection involving MatH-HVR-BMV. Fifty-five percent of analyzed lesions contained the RNA3 recombinant. In all sequenced recombinants, one HVR and the spacer were deleted (Figure 5C). Their 3′-UTR was composed of a 295 nt RNA1-derived sequence and HVRs followed by the CP coding region. All lesions developed on plants infected with MatH-X-BMV accumulated parental MatH-X-RNA3 molecules only.
The presence of homologous and non-homologous recombinants in the examined lesions was always confirmed not only by RT–PCR but also by northern blot analysis (Figure 6). This revealed the same tendency as that observed earlier using the heteromolecular system (30,33). BMV accumulated to a very low level in lesions containing parental RNA3 (original molecules with duplicated sequences—Figure 6A, lane 5 and Figure 6B, lane 2). However, this changed in lesions where a recombinant was generated (Figure 6A, lanes 1–4 and Figure 6B, lanes 1 and 3).
Earlier it was shown that the BMV-based heteromolecular system can be used as an effective tool for investigating the mechanism of homologous and non-homologous recombination, although it is only suitable for testing the recombination activity of the sequences derived from the 3′-portion of BMV RNA1 or RNA2 (30,33). To overcome this problem, we attempted to create a new universal recombination in vivo system. The collected data suggested that a BMV RNA3-based homomolecular system would best fulfill our expectations. To confirm the correctness of the above presumption, to determine the efficacy of the homomolecular system and to compare it with the heteromolecular one, two mixed homo–heteromolecular systems were constructed—one to study homologous (MatH-BMV) and the other non-homologous (MatNH-BMV) recombination.
The mixed systems were prepared in such a way that two identical or two complementary sequences were capable of supporting homologous or non-homologous crossovers, respectively, either between molecules representing the same segment of the BMV genome (modified RNA3) or between molecules representing two different segments of the BMV genome (wtRNA1 and modified RNA3). Experiments involving MatH- and MatNH-BMV showed that recombination can occur both in homo- and heteromolecular systems and proved that the former should be at least as effective as the previously utilized heteromolecular one. Interestingly, the RAS1s sequence did not support homologous recombination during infection with MH-BMV (heteromolecular system) and it was quite active in the mixed system. This clearly demonstrates that not only primary and secondary structure but also the location of RAS within the viral genome affects its ability to mediate homologous crossovers. The undertaken experiments also revealed that homologous recombination occurs more often between two different RNAs (RNA1 and RNA3), while non-homologous recombination usually involves molecules representing the same segment of the BMV genome (RNA3). The obtained results constitute yet another piece of evidence that the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination are different. The same conclusion was reached by us earlier while studying the influence of specific mutations in BMV-encoded protein 2a (26,27). We identified among other the mutation in the 2a protein, which inhibits non-homologous crossovers without affecting the frequency of homologous ones.
At present, it is difficult to judge at which stage of the recombination process the observed differences occur. One can only suppose that the structural requirements of transfer of the replicase-nascent strand complex from the donor to the acceptor molecule must be different in homologous and non-homologous recombination. In the case of the former, a basic factor facilitating this process is complementarity between the acceptor and the nascent strand. Consequently, there is no necessity for the replication complex to be stable during homologous crossovers (22). Replicase can leave the donor template alone or together with a nascent strand. Then, the 3′ end of the newly synthesized RNA molecule can function as a guide; it can find a complementary sequence in the acceptor RNA, hybridize and serve as a primer allowing viral replicase to reinitiate RNA synthesis. In non-homologous heteroduplex-mediated recombination, a factor enhancing crossover seems to be the interaction between the donor and the acceptor (the formation of a local double-stranded region) (30,33). Considering that BMV genomic RNAs are copied within spherules (44), intramolecular hybridization between RAS1s and RAS1as, located in MatNH-RNA3, is much more likely. Thus, the results presented here indicate that the way the virus replicates can strongly affect the recombination process. However, further detailed studies are necessary in order to explain this phenomenon.
Based on results obtained using the heteromolecular (30,33) and mixed systems, we constructed a new homomolecular one. Its most crucial element is the Mat0-RNA3 vector, into which both tested sequences can be introduced. In order to show the usefulness of this system, we employed it to test the recombination activity of two distinctly different sequences deriving from the genome of an RNA virus not related to BMV. Our choice was the 98 nt sequence X and an HVR both from HCV genome. There are many reasons as to why the two sequences can be deemed drastically different. The most important of them are (i) sequence X is placed in a non-coding region, while HVR in a coding one, (ii) sequence X is the least variable and HVR the most variable fragment of the HCV genome (42,43,45), (iii) unlike to HVR, sequence X possesses a very stable and well-defined secondary and tertiary structure (42,45).
We ascertained that the introduction of HVR into the Mat0-RNA3 vector (in sense/sense and antisense/sense orientation) does not influence BMV infectivity. The latter was, however, reduced if HVR was replaced with sequence X. We found that HVR supports homologous recombination and HVRs and its complementary counterpart HVRas mediate non-homologous crossovers. The frequency of homologous recombination amounted to 55% and of non-homologous to 100%. Sequence Xs did not support homologous crossovers but Xs and complementary sequence Xas were capable of inducing non-homologous ones (their frequency reaching 90%).
The obtained results testify that the local double-stranded structures induce non-homologous recombination crossovers very efficiently. This may reflect the capacity of RNA viruses to remove inverted repeats from their genomes. Viruses lacking such ability would be an easy target for double-stranded RNA-induced RNA silencing, which is known as the plant antiviral mechanism (46). Moreover, the data presented suggest that sequence X, which adopts a very compact and stable structure (45), is not able to mediate homologous recombination. It occurs efficiently within AU-rich HVR sequences whose structure is more labile and dynamic (42). Earlier research on homologous recombination in BMV led to similar conclusions. It was shown that homologous recombination occurs effectively in AU-rich regions (47) and is not observed within highly structured 3′- and 5′-UTR (48). These observations concur with the proposed mechanism of homologous RNA recombination (22). It assumes that AU-rich regions facilitate the detachment of the polymerase-nascent strand complex from donor RNA. On the other hand, it is thought that the stability of RNA structure makes the hybridization of the nascent strand and/or replicase to the acceptor difficult.
Currently, it is becoming increasingly clear that RNA recombination plays a very complex role in a virus' life cycle. Not only does it permit the exchange of genetic material between viruses (3,4,22), frequent homologous crossovers between molecules representing the same segment of the virus genome also stabilize genetic information (48). Moreover, here we showed that homologous and non-homologous recombination might control the organization of the virus genome by removing direct or inverted repeats, which affect the virus' ability to replicate or accumulate in the infected cells. Interestingly, we observed that complementary sequences are more effectively deleted than homologous ones. It seems that some of the latter can prevail in the viral genome probably due to their compact stable structure that prevents recombination events.
Altogether, the data presented here prove that the newly created BMV-based homomolecular recombination system can be used to examine in vivo recombination activity of various RNA sequences derived from the genomes of related or unrelated viruses. However, there are other factors which, in addition to RNA structure, can affect the course of the studied process. Specific properties of the viral replicase and the host proteins that are necessary for recombination events can be of equally great importance. Therefore, there is a need to create similar universal recombination systems in other viruses. We believe that these systems will be very helpful in finding some general rules in RNA recombination and will provide us with knowledge which is indispensable to understand how new RNA viruses or retroviruses are generated.

36. Engendering enthusiasm for sustainable disaster critical care response: why this is of consequence to critical care professionals?
Disasters have been a part of human existence since ancient times, and so has disaster medicine [1]. We define disaster medicine as a human response to unexpected mayhem, with the intent to limit death, disease, and injury. In recent decades, disaster medical response has largely focused on prehospital care issues such as casualty evacuation, triage, and transport, without specific emphasis on hospital management. In the United States, this phenomenon is referred to as 'ambulances to nowhere'. Recent experiences with large-scale disasters have strongly reinforced the fact that hospital capacity is the major rate-limiting factor in the chain of medical response. This is especially true for critical care services and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity [2]. As we continue working to build adequate disaster medical response systems we must maintain our prehospital readiness efforts, and we must expand our focus to more precisely define the hospital and the ICU as critical links in the entire response process. The purpose of the present commentary is to explore ways in which this expansion of focus might be conceived.
A number of recent examples illustrate the importance of the hospital and the ICU in the medical response to disaster. Within a few hours of the Madrid bombing explosions in March 2004, 27 critically ill patients were admitted to the two closest hospitals, which had a maximum ICU capacity of 28 beds, most of which were already occupied [3]. After the terrorist bombing in Bali, the Royal Darwin Hospital in Australia, with a capacity to care for a maximum of 12 ventilated patients, was presented with 20 critically ill patients, 15 of whom required mechanical ventilation [4]. Flooding due to heavy rain in June 2001 crippled the Texas Medical Center in Houston, and resulted in a sudden loss of 75% of the ICU bed capacity for a county of 4 million people [5]. And it is not just ICU bed capacity that is subject to being overwhelmed. Damage to the physical and organizational structure of the hospital may wipe out an entire critical care infrastructure. Some disasters may harm healthcare workers, thus limiting available ICU personnel. This was the case during the Tokyo Sarin gas subway attack in 1995, and more recently during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Canada and Asia [6].
Viewed in the context of the everyday strain on our currently available resources, the challenge is even greater [7]. An analysis of the capacity of a 1200-bed hospital in the United States to handle patients in the setting of a toxic chemical exposure event revealed an ability to handle only two chemically contaminated patients at a time [8]. Add to this the fact that in many countries, because of efficiency and budgetary constraints, hospitals are shrinking in capacity. This has resulted in hospitals working at or near maximum capacity every day, with associated logistical concerns such as overcrowding, diversion of ambulance services, and lack of surge capacity. Particularly important is the inability of emergency departments to move critically ill patients to their inpatient setting [9] due to the unavailability of staffed critical care beds. With future projections for a shortage of critical care physicians [10] and critical care nurses [11,12], these logistical barriers to ICU care will persist [13] and will influence the provision of disaster critical care response.
Taken together, this means that we do not need a major disaster like a terrorist attack or an emerging infectious disease epidemic to tip the strained balance between the supply and demand of critical care resources. Disasters of a local scale alone can tip the balance, such as when a fire broke out at a nightclub in Rhode Island in 2003. The local hospital immediately received 40 critically-ill patients, most requiring intensive care support [14].
Education and training are effective modalities that tangibly enhance disaster medical response at every level. However, current disaster medical education programs for healthcare professionals are not coordinated in scope and content, and may not address the most pressing needs for critical care personnel. What are the imperatives that must be taught? For example, it would be an error to assume that principles of triage, recognition of smallpox, antibiotics for anthrax, proper dosing of atropine, and so forth, represent a sufficient knowledge base. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2003 emphatically demonstrated that scrupulous training and execution of infection control practices became a survival skill for ICU personnel. Unfortunately, this is not substantially represented in our current disaster medical education programs.
Does this mean we need to build more beds, hire additional specialized personnel, or stockpile antibiotics, antidotes, and equipment against a possible disaster situation? We think not; this would be unworkably expensive and would still leave us incompletely prepared for many of the disaster scenarios just described. So, what are the solutions? We offer the following suggestions in order of priority. These concepts attempt to build on existing resources. We do not pretend to offer evidence-based guidelines. Rather, our intention is to engender discussion and dialog.
Pre-emptive education is the single most effective tool we can employ to mitigate the future effects of a disaster. In terms of impact, the education of healthcare professionals is at the top of the list [15]. The educational initiatives we propose to accomplish this goal are as follows: heightened disaster response awareness, enhanced skill sets, understanding of roles and responsibilities, alternate communication methods, self-preservation training, and experience in how to cooperate and coordinate during mayhem.
Medical preparedness training should not be limited to first-line treatment, but must include targeted training that covers the entire disaster medical spectrum [16]. The challenge is distilling all of this into a curriculum that fits the very limited time availability of healthcare professionals. As one evolving example, the Society of Critical Care Medicine has developed a standardized and highly concentrated course (Fundamentals of Disaster Management) to equip critical care professionals with basic but essential disaster medical knowledge. The content of this program is still in evolution.
Disaster response medical simulation approximating actual scenarios enables disaster planners and responders to test procedures and technologies, and to incorporate the lessons learned from past disasters [17]. This simulation has been shown to be effective [16,18]. The level of realism is much higher than in facility-based exercises, where time and personnel utilization are compressed and usually do not adequately teach disaster resource management.
Finally, there is a useful role for what is termed 'just-in-time training'. The intent of these programs is to make concise knowledge available to providers, at the time of an event and at the point of care. Most of these are Web-based knowledge collections that can be queried. This approach is less time intensive, less labor intensive, and less cost intensive than traditional educational processes. We should point out, however, that 'just-in-time training' serves as an adjunct, but alone it is not an adequate replacement for the other methods enumerated here. Any 'just-in-time training' program is only as effective as the skills of the professional in accessing the training when it is needed, which must be in place beforehand.
Experience has shown that the burden of disaster medical response largely falls to healthcare facilities proximate to an event. Despite the widely held impression that 'the government will be there', outside help and intervention typically does not have a large impact on the initial phases of disaster medical response. We have already outlined some of the obstacles, such as strained resources or lack of communication and training, that impede cooperation. While most hospitals have plans for response to local disasters mapped out, plans that looked good on paper often go awry during execution [19]. In terms of interfacility cooperation, given that many local hospitals financially compete with each other, teamwork in the event of a disaster is expected to materialize where it has not been previously encouraged. As such, the results are seldom efficient.
A rational approach to tackle this issue includes the development of flexible and scalable plans for interchanging resources to augment the existing capacity of individual hospitals [20]. For example, many communities currently divide disaster responsibilities according to the type and severity of injuries among the various hospitals. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of casualties make their own way to the hospital, irrespective of these plans. A better way would be to build flexible surge capacity that allows hospital personnel to move from one facility to another according to need. Such adaptation to circumstances will not happen spontaneously, and will require significant pre-planning. An additional example of efficient sharing is disaster medical education; many or all of the educational proposals outlined in the previous section could be shared, increasing availability, cost-effectiveness and, probably, quality.
As we have suggested, the cost of effective disaster planning is enormous. It is not realistic to expect budget-constrained facilities to absorb these additional costs, and yet relief from governments will not fill the gap. It therefore seems reasonable to seek economies of scale, such as dual-use modalities. For example, to increase ICU surge capacity, consider our ability to provide critical care outside of a designated geographical location. A significant volume of critical care is provided (nondeliberately) every day outside the geographical constraints of an ICU, hence the growing development of medical emergency teams in hospitals around the world [21]. With little additional training, these teams could provide a highly effective adjunctive capability during disaster medical response when critical care units are full but additional ICU services are required.
As a second example, ensuring patient safety in the hospital is also emerging as a significant resource-consuming, but essential, activity [22]. This is especially true as we move beyond compliance activities into multidisciplinary, tiered accident and error prevention. From this perspective, a medical catastrophe may encompass a single patient who receives improper medication through to mass casualty circumstances. While these events are fundamentally different in scope, magnitude, and cause, they share at their core a need for accurate and complete planning and education to prevent or mitigate their consequences. Is there sufficient overlap to merge some of the planning, education, and practice of hospital patient safety and disaster medical response?
In summary, where we have been will not get us to where we need to go for disaster critical care response. First, we must work around apathy, confusion of purpose, and a lack of monetary resources to widen the spotlight of disaster medical response from the prehospital arena to include the hospital. We must enhance our abilities and capacity across the whole spectrum of disaster medical response.
These efforts are the responsibility of society as a whole. All involved organizations including hospitals, emergency medical services, fire services, police, the public health system, local municipalities and government authorities, and other health care institutions will need to integrate into a well-developed disaster educational system and response team [23]. In the present article we have attempted to outline conceptual elements that may facilitate some of this integration. For this to happen, someone with comprehensive understanding and the necessary expertise is required nationally, regionally, and locally to provide the leadership imperative that drives integration of these disparate entities and resources. The first step is ownership, and as critical care professionals we are obliged to step forward and provide the leadership for these processes.

37. Biochip sensors for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral disease
In 2003, China took measures to contain an outbreak of 'flu-like illness' [1]; when the same disease (which came to be called severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS) began to appear in other countries, the World Health Organization initiated a global response [2]. This incident highlighted, on a world stage, the need for rapid and accurate techniques for pathogen identification. Failure to have such tools puts lives at risk by severely hampering containment and effective vaccination strategies.
Over the past few decades, the identification and characterization of infectious agents has been refined and improved, resulting in highly sensitive and precise methodologies that will soon be able to measure individual molecules. This sensitivity comes at a cost, however, in terms of time, complexity of assay, and robustness of measurements, and this can have a negative impact on patient care. The prognosis for the majority of serious infections is vastly improved by early intervention, so the development of rapid detection and identification methods is essential, but this must not come at the expense of sensitivity. In the case of hepatitis C infection, for example, diagnosis needs low levels of virus to be detected [3], and this demands a high level of assay sensitivity. For these reasons there is an ever-increasing requirement for rapid, sensitive technologies that provide better diagnosis and clinical management of infectious diseases. In an effort to address that need, modern medicine has seen a revolution in new high-throughput approaches. Advances in genomics, microarrays and imaging technologies, in particular, have revolutionized the way in which infectious-disease problems are being addressed. Here, we briefly examine how such technologies are being applied to the detection and identification of viruses and the impact such systems might have in the clinic.
Until recently, virus detection and identification in the clinical setting has been centered around immunological or PCR-based techniques. One of the primary immunological techniques is the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of circulating virus-specific antibodies. By contrast, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR is used to detect the presence of viral genomes or specific viral genes. A combined approach using both techniques overcomes detection problems when either the infection produces a weak antibody response or when virus-specific transcripts are in low abundance. Both these approaches have well documented limitations, however. Immunological tests are hampered by the need for specific antisera that are both laborious and time-consuming to produce, whereas PCR, while being a definite advance in sensitive virus detection, is prone to failure and false recordings and is limited in its ability to identify multiple viruses simultaneously [4]. We therefore need a rapid, sensitive approach that is capable of identifying multiple viruses in parallel; this need is being addressed by the development of DNA and protein microarrays specifically designed for virus detection and identification.
The basic design principle is the same for all forms of microarray, whether based on DNA, protein or cells. Specific molecular 'targets' are detected simultaneously within the sample of interest by an array of 'probes'. The probes, often numbering thousands, are chemically attached in an array format to a solid substrate to construct either a DNA or a protein microarray (Figure 1). But the microarray concept is not limited to the use of just DNA or protein probes. Indeed, in recent years the concept has been greatly expanded to include the production of all manner of arrayed probes: cells, glycans and carbohydrates, to name but a few. The significance of the microarray to the field of infectious diseases is the parallel detection capabilities of the system (covered in more detail in [5]). Microarrays offer the ability to achieve simultaneous detection of many targets, and through optimization this can be achieved without detriment to sensitivity.
DNA microarrays for viral analysis can be divided into viral chips and host chips, and each can be applied not only to detection and identification but also to the monitoring of viral populations. In 1999, we and colleagues [6] described the first viral DNA microarray for the temporal profiling of viral (human cytomegalovirus, HCMV) gene expression. Treatment of infected cells with cycloheximide or ganciclovir was used to block de novo protein synthesis or viral replication, respectively, and the microarray was then used to generate expression profiles of the viral genes represented on the chip. Using this approach, HCMV genes were assigned to immediate-early, early or late expression classes, depending on their expression profile in response to the drug treatments. If the expression profile is sufficiently unique, it can be used as an identifying hybridization signature for the molecular staging of an infection.
We described the idea of unique hybridization patterns being used for the identification of viral inhibitors [6], and in 2002 this idea was applied by Wang et al. [4] to the detection and identification of viruses. The authors [4] described the use of viral DNA microarrays to produce hybridization signatures of viral sequences that effectively serve as 'viral barcodes' for the identification of known, related or novel viruses. By taking advantage of the highly conserved regions within gene families, the authors were able to produce an array that could identify related viruses and discriminate between serotypes. The ability to distinguish subtypes is critical to effective infection management in the clinic: variola virus, for example, is an orthopoxvirus that causes smallpox and has two subtypes, variola major and variola minor, of differing pathogenicity. Laassri et al. [7] addressed the problem of orthopoxvirus subtype discrimination by producing an array capable of correctly identifying four of the orthopoxvirus species. Similarly, arrays have been developed for the detection and distinction of hantaviruses [8] and are capable of distinguishing between isolates that have up to 90% sequence similarity. Other groups have focused on the genotyping of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza [9,10].
The ability to monitor the divergence of virus strains is critical for maintaining the effectiveness of current vaccines and ensuring the safety of vaccines that use live, attenuated viruses. Cherkasova et al. [11] have demonstrated the use of oligonucleotide microarrays in the analysis of vaccine-derived polioviruses. They describe two chip-based approaches. The 'microarrays for resequencing and sequence heterogeneity' (MARSH) method uses probes with overlapping sequences from within the coding region of the gene for the poliovirus structural polypeptide VP1 to detect point mutations that have occurred and to determine regions of differing genome stability. By contrast, the 'microarray analysis of viral recombination' (MAVR) method can detect recombination events within virus strains by analyzing patterns of hybridization to probes unique to specific virus strains. Used in combination these chips provide a rapid genotype profile.
Viral chips provide a unique signature derived from the viral transcriptome or genome alone. An alternative approach is to examine the host response: changes in host gene expression provide a molecular signature of infection, an idea explored by Cummings and Relman [12]. The availability of commercial chips covering the whole host genome, from companies such as Affymetrix, allows genome-wide changes to be examined. Alternatively, smaller customized host chips can be constructed with a more restricted number of probes. One of the first groups to adopt this approach identified 258 cellular mRNAs whose level changed by a factor of four or greater before the onset of HCMV DNA replication [13]. Later, Domachowske et al. [14] examined pneumovirus strain differences and their ability to induce antiviral inflammation, and van't Wout et al. [15] examined HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells to identify changes in host gene expression that were specific to HIV infection and that did not occur in cells that had been heat shocked, treated with interferon or infected with influenza A virus. Host gene signatures identified included pro-inflammatory genes and genes involved in endoplasmic-reticulum stress pathways, the cell cycle and apoptosis. A cardinal signature and common molecular thread for all infections appears to be the markers in the interferon pathway.
Microarray applications such as those described above offer an accurate, rapid and sensitive method for the detection and identification of viruses, but they have important limitations that should be considered. The production of robust unique hybridization signatures - viral barcodes - which can be used to correctly identify a viral infection depends on a number of influencing variables. For example, signatures may be altered dramatically according to variations in the viral load, the stage of infection or the tissues sampled. Obtaining the DNA for hybridization could also be problematic for some infections: infected tissues may be inaccessible and could yield little nucleic acid.
Protein arrays can also be constructed for the detection and identification of viruses. Viral antigens can be arrayed and used to detect serum antibodies, or antibodies can be arrayed and used to detect pathogens. Bacarese-Hamilton et al. [16] applied protein microarrays to the detection of antibodies to the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, CMV and herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) type 1 and 2. Antigens were arrayed and used to detect serum immunoglobins IgG and IgM down to 0.5 pg, and the system was validated by comparison with existing ELISAs. The results showed 80% agreement between ELISA and array, and confirmed that smaller reagent and sample volumes are used by the array. They also highlighted the advantage of the array's internal calibration curve: by processing the calibration curve on the array and not in separate tubes, as is done in ELISA, matrix effects that are known to bias ELISAs were reduced.
Once constructed, protein arrays can be air-dried and easily stored at room temperature [17]; their production and use are readily automated and they offer a cost-effective alternative to ELISAs. In contrast to DNA arrays, protein arrays cannot provide a readout of global changes in protein expression, since extensive libraries of globally expressed proteins simply do not exist [18]. It is still possible, however, to generate protein analyte 'signatures' by using a specific selection of targeted proteins. For instance, cytokine responses to viral infection can vary greatly between viruses; by arraying antibodies to a spectrum of cytokines it is possible to generate a 'cytokine signature' of infection that is readily identifiable. The application of such technology to the clinic would, however, require a concerted effort to characterize and collate such cytokine signatures. Considering that each signature is subject to a number of variables, each of which can produce a significantly different output, establishing a catalog of viral identifiers that are consistently accurate would be no mean feat.
Despite the rapidity and sensitivity offered by systems that use microarray detection and identification, recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to engineer cell-based systems that outstrip microarrays in terms of speed of detection. Rider et al. [19] demonstrated the use of engineered B cells capable of detecting pathogens within 3 minutes (Figure 2). Their CANARY sensor (cellular analysis and notification of antigen risks and yields) comprises B cells that express the calcium-dependent bioluminescent protein aequorin together with membrane-bound pathogen-specific antibodies. Binding of the pathogen to the cell-surface antibodies triggers an elevation in intracellular calcium ions that in turn causes the aequorin to emit light, all within a matter of seconds. One of the engineered B-cell lines described by the authors could detect spores of Bacillus anthracis, a pathogen already feared by the general public in relation to terror attacks, highlighting the relevance of such a technique. These investigators [19] used naturally occurring pattern-recognition molecules - antibodies - but such systems are by no means restricted to the natural world; for instance, Golumbfskie et al. [20] have investigated the possibility of developing synthetic systems capable of specific recognition between polymers and surfaces. Such biomimetic approaches may have future applications in both cell-based and microarray sensor technologies.
More recently, Perlman et al. [21], have described multidimensional drug profiling by automated microscopy. The authors used automated microscopy to create profiles, analogous to those generated by microarray data, of changes in cellular phenotype resulting from drug treatment; the profiles could then be used to categorize various unknown drugs [21]. This cell-array technique should complement existing technology and allow rapid, cost-effective collection of data or individual cellular responses. Although the results are in the context of drug treatments, one can easily imagine the application of such a technique to the detection of infectious diseases. A system such as this, capable of creating profiles based on phenotypic changes in individual cells, would be a powerful tool. This technology illustrates how the ability to measure changes at the molecular level can allow us to turn individual cells into sensors.
Despite the fact that microarray-based technologies are becoming increasingly rapid, cheap and ever more sensitive, there are still drawbacks. One approach to maximizing the effectiveness of existing technology is to combine complementary technologies (Figure 3). Microarrays provide the opportunity to develop a system whereby multiple viral infections can be identified in parallel by their hybridization signatures or 'viral barcodes'. Cellular systems, such as the light-emitting B cells engineered by the Rider group [19], while individually not having the parallel capabilities of the array, provide an extremely rapid detection system. In the future, therefore, we could see the production of hybrid technologies: 'cell-omic sensors', which have the parallel high-throughput capabilities of arrays coupled with the speed of the engineered B cells. This may take the form of microarrays constructed by arraying a panel of engineered cells, for instance, or even synthetic biomimetic systems. Alternatively, advances could allow arrays to be constructed that combine cellular sensors with gene or protein probes. It may be possible to take advantage of the immune system's natural pathogen sensors - macrophages or dendritic cells for example - arrayed onto protein probes or sensors of some description in such a way that cellular changes induced by contact with a pathogen can be measured in real time.
The goal of generating hybrid arrays of cells within arrays of protein probes is increasingly feasible with advances in science and technology. Ultimately it might be possible to engineer a 'microarray' within a cell, allowing real-time, continuous monitoring of complex signatures of infection. The goal of having an addressable array within a cell from which signals can be measured without perturbing cellular function may, for example, be enabled through the use of new nanomaterials that act as intermediaries between the biological system and the physical system used for measurement. Several types of nanomaterial, such as carbon nanotubes [22], gold nanoshells [23] and quantum dots [24], have unique electronic or optical properties that could be tuned to detect biomolecular concentrations within cells. In these examples, the nanomaterials may link with systems such as advanced silicon microelectronics or advanced imaging techniques such as fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) or Raman microscopy.
There is a strong need for rapid, sensitive pathogen-detection systems that can be easily applied to the clinic, industry or even the 'battlefield'. It is important to acknowledge, however, that the transition of these technologies from the bench to real-world application depends on certain requirements. A number of groups have produced array data that could be used to produce viral barcodes or unique identifiers. These efforts, whether at the DNA or protein level, are currently disparate, uncoordinated and mainly confined to studies in vitro. A collection of such infection profiles, an Infection Profile Database, for example, needs to be put together that sets out standards and requirements that would help such high-dimensional data to be translated into clinical utility. Indeed, such information would provide a valuable resource for constructing specific cell-based sensors or even synthetic sensors.
One of the overwhelming problems related to the creation of unique signatures that will consistently and accurately identify an infection is the fact that the signatures depend on a large number of variables. A potential solution might involve identifying a signature that is produced early in infection and yet can be sustained for capturing later. This idea is perhaps not too far-fetched, and it may well involve certain immune cells, in particular those destined to become antigen-driven memory cells. Although various responses can be used to identify an infection, the heterogeneity of the system we propose (Figure 3) may be too variable, and thus the detection of these responses would require all patients to present within a very narrow characterized window for their output to be informative. In clinical terms, this scenario is obviously completely unrealistic. The question is whether infections leave early footprints that are unique and readable, or whether the response to infection as a whole is simply too dynamic. Answers to these questions are tractable but will require carefully controlled and appropriately powered studies as well as standardization of data measurements and quality assurance. Increasing attention is being given to these critical areas, and as a consequence we are in exciting times in this rapidly moving field.

38. Peptide inhibitors of dengue virus and West Nile virus infectivity
Enveloped viruses utilize membrane-bound fusion proteins to mediate attachment and entry into specific target host cells. During the virion assembly process, newly synthesized envelope proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus where initial folding and post-transcriptional processing occurs, including multimerization, glycosylation, and proteolysis. This initial folding and processing is required to achieve a conformation where the proteins are held in a metastable state prior to virion release. Post virion release, the multimeric envelope proteins are poised to undergo structural rearrangement leading to fusion of the virion and the new target cell lipid bilayer membranes. Depending on the virus system, the rearrangement trigger can take the form of specific receptor binding, multiple receptor binding, decreased pH following receptor mediated endocytosis, or a combination of triggers.
The prototypic viral envelope fusion protein, the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, contains short alpha helical domains in the trimeric virion configuration. In response to receptor binding and decreased pH, the short helices rearrange with adjoining sequences to produce a longer helix, thus exposing an N-terminal fusion peptide that is believed to interact directly with the target cell membrane. This is followed by a hinge-like bending of the entire complex to adjoin and fuse the two lipid membranes [2,3]. The structural rearrangements that result in extrusion of the fusion peptide and subsequent collapse involve alterations in packing between regions both within individual fusion proteins as well as between monomeric subunits in the trimeric structures. Several disparate viruses, including arenaviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses and retroviruses, encode similar proteins that together are classified as class I fusion proteins. These class I viral fusion proteins vary in length and sequence, but are similar in overall structure [4,5].
Qureshi et al. (1990) demonstrated that a peptide from one of the two extended helical domains of the HIV-1 transmembrane protein can block virion infectivity. Subsequently, the FDA approved anti-HIV-1 drug Fuzeon™ (aka DP178, T-20, enfuvirtide) and other N- and C-helix inhibitory peptides were developed [6,7]. These results have greatly motivated the search for other HIV-1 inhibitory peptides [8,9]. Additional peptide mimics of the fusion proteins of other retroviruses, and of orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses, and herpesviruses have also been identified and shown to inhibit viral entry [10-18]
The envelope fusion proteins of several virus types, including the flaviviruses and alphaviruses, have a structure distinct from class I viral fusion proteins. The envelope glycoprotein (E) of the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) consists of three domains: a structurally central amino terminal domain (domain I), a dimerization domain (domain II) and a carboxyl terminal Ig-like domain (domain III), all containing predominantly beta sheet folds [19]. The primary sequence of E1, the fusion protein of Semliki Forest virus, an alphavirus, revealed a remarkable fit to the scaffold of TBEV E [20] suggesting the existence of a second class of viral fusion proteins. The dengue virus (DENV) E protein has also been shown to have a class II structure [21]. Recent studies of flavivirus virions and proteins by cryoelectron microscopy and crystal structure analysis have lead to a greatly increased understanding of the function of these class II viral envelope proteins, including the structural rearrangements they undergo during maturation, triggering and fusion [21-28].
The flaviviruses, which include DENV, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and TBEV, among others, are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by insect vectors. The most serious manifestations of DENV infection are dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There are four serotypes of DENV (1–4), which together cause an estimated 50 million human infections per year [29], and each can cause DF, DHF or DSS. Because of the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), or other immune phenomena, protection against one DENV serotype increases the risk of DHF or DSS when the individual is exposed to another serotype [30-32]. Cross-reactive, but non-neutralizing antibodies can mediate entry of DENV into macrophages, dendritic cells and other viral target cells via Fc receptors, increasing virus titers and thus pathology. Multivalent DENV vaccines have shown some promise in humans [32-39] and in nonhuman primate studies [40,41], but face several obstacles. Antiviral drugs, which target each of the four serotypes of DENV without enhancing pathogenesis of any serotype, are urgently needed. The recent introduction of WNV in the United States further highlights the public health challenges posed by flaviviruses. No effective vaccine or antiviral drug therapy is currently available against either DENV or WNV.
Although there are many differences between the structures of class I and class II viral fusion proteins, we hypothesized that they function through a similar membrane fusion mechanism involving rearrangements of domains, and that peptides mimicking portions of class II viral fusion proteins would inhibit virion fusion and entry steps thereby serving as lead compounds for the development of antivirals. We used a physio-chemical algorithm, the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale [1] in combination with known structural data to predict regions of the DENV and WNV E proteins that may play roles in protein-protein rearrangements or bilayer membrane interactions during the entry and fusion process. Several of these peptides specifically inhibit DENV or WNV infection.
The domains that precede the transmembrane anchors of most class I fusion proteins are not highly hydrophobic, however, they usually contain a cluster of aromatic amino acids and display a tendency to partition into bilayer membranes, as revealed by analyses using the experimentally-determined Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS) [42]. Fuzeon's corresponding sequence overlaps the aromatic pre-anchor domain of HIV-1 TM. Synthetic peptides corresponding to other domains of class I viral fusion proteins with significant WWIHS scores may also inhibit viral infectivity [43]. Previously, we suggested that peptide drugs analogous to Fuzeon might be developed for HCV and other members of the Flaviviridae [44]. DENV E contains five domains with significant WWIHS scores (Fig. 1, WWIHS sequences in black). These include the fusion peptide domain, a portion of subdomain IIb, the pre-anchor stem region following domain III, and the transmembrane domain. Sequences with high WWIHS scores are similarly located in the X-ray structures of WNV E and alphavirus (SFV and Sindbis virus – SINV) E1, and potentially also in the putative class II fusion proteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV), pestiviruses and bunyaviruses [44,45]. Regions with high WWIHS scores are predicted to play a role in protein-protein interactions during structural rearrangements or protein-lipid interactions during bilayer fusion, and we predicted that synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions may have the potential to inhibit flavivirus infectivity.
To test this hypothesis, an initial set of synthetic peptides representing sequences of DENV E and WNV E with significant WWIHS scores was synthesized and screened for the ability to inhibit plaque formation by these flaviviruses (Table 1). Peptides corresponding to the transmembrane domain were not tested because this region is not exposed during the entry process. Initial assays for inhibitory activity were performed using the highest concentration of each peptide that could be obtained in aqueous solution with a maximum of 1% DMSO (between 29 and 128 μM). Plaque reduction in which the inhibitor is removed after virus adsorption is the most stringent test of an antiviral agent. Prior to initiating these studies, we developed a new immunoplaque assay for DENV and WNV. Approximately 200 focus forming units (FFU) of either WNV or DENV were preincubated with each of the peptides and used to infect monolayers of LLCKM-2 monkey kidney epithelial cells. The number of resulting viral foci was determined from three experiments and normalized to a no-peptide control to calculate the percent inhibition. Our screening of this initial set detected several peptides that were able to inhibit infection by DENV or WNV (Table 1, Fig. 2). Peptides similar in sequence to domains with a significant WWIHS scores, including domain II (IIb) (WN53 and WN83), and stem domain (DN59), were found to have inhibitory activity.
Dose-response curves were determined for the most potent of the peptides WN53 and WN83 against WNV and also for peptide DN59 against DENV (Fig. 3). The WN53 peptide showed a maximum inhibitory activity against WNV of 56.0 +/- 3.0% (mean +/- SD) at 99 μM. The inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing concentration with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) at roughly 10 μM. The WN83 peptide showed a maximum inhibitory activity against WNV of 70.0 +/- 3.0% at 128 μM. The inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing concentration with an IC50 of roughly 10 μM. The DN59 peptide showed a maximum inhibitory activity against DENV of 100.0 +/- 0.5% at 20 μM. The inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing concentration with an IC50 of at roughly 10 μM. DENV stem peptide 59 (DN59) and WNV peptides 53 and 83 (WN53, WN83) reproducibly inhibited infectivity at low μM concentrations.
The DN59 peptide matches a pre-anchor domain sequence that is highly conserved among insect-transmitted flaviviruses. DN59 inhibited infection by DENV (>99% inhibition of plaque formation at a concentrations of <25 μM). Cross-inhibition of WNV fusion/infectivity (>99% inhibition at <25 μM) was also reproducibly demonstrated with DN59 (Fig. 6). However, WNV inhibitory peptide WN83 did not inhibit infectivity by DENV.
To determine if these peptides specifically inhibit infectivity of the viruses for which they were designed, the WN53, WN83 and DN59 peptides were tested for inhibitory effects against Sindbis virus (SINV), an alphavirus that encodes a class II fusion protein. None of the peptides showed a statistically significant effect against SINV infectivity (Fig. 4). Peptides with the same amino acid composition as WN83 and DN59, but a scrambled sequence (Scrambled WN83: VATWHLDWSREFPLFLMNS; Scrambled DN59: YFIDTSGAIWGASHLTGVLFDFMGIQGGAVLAK) were synthesized and tested for the ability to inhibit infection by WNV and DENV respectively. Neither scrambled peptide significantly inhibited infection by these viruses (Fig. 5). These results provide evidence that the action of these inhibitory peptides not due to general inactivation of enveloped virions and is sequence specific.
It is possible that inhibitory peptides induce cellular alterations or toxicity that can block flavivirus entry or other steps in the replication cycle. To address this possibility, LLCMK-2 monkey kidney epithelial cell monolayers were exposed to 100 mg/ml concentrations of WN53, WN83 and DN59 peptides for 24 hrs, and cell viability was assayed with an MTT assay. No statistical difference was observed between the viability of control cells versus cells exposed to the peptides or DMSO (Fig. 7). This result suggests that these inhibitory peptides are not blocking infectivity via effects on host cell metabolism or viability.
When added in combination, peptides that block entry at different steps or that target different domains may produce greater inhibition of DENV-2 infectivity than either peptide alone. Synergistic or antagonistic effects are also possible, if a peptide that alters protein-protein interactions allows greater or lesser access to E domains targeted by another peptide. Since the WN53, WN83 and DN59 peptides all inhibited WNV entry, the possibility of antagonistic or synergistic function was examined by testing WN53 and DN59 alone or in combination at three concentrations (5, 10 and 20 μM). At all three concentrations, the peptide combination was more effective than WN53 alone, but less effective than DN59 alone. This indicates that the activity of the WN53 peptide has an antagonistic effect on the function of the DN59 peptide (Fig. 6).
Synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences in DENV and WNV E proteins were identified that inhibited infectivity of these viral pathogens of major public health importance. The inhibitory effects of these peptides were dose dependent with IC50s in the range of 10 μM. Several of the most potent of these peptides showed no inhibitory activity against SINV, an alphavirus that possesses a class II viral fusion protein with a similar overall structure as flavivirus E. Scrambled peptides with the same amino acid composition as the inhibitory peptides, but with a different primary sequence, failed to inhibit DENV and WNV infection. None of the DENV or WNV inhibitory peptides induced gross cytopathic effects, killing of cultured cells or showed evidence of in vitro cellular toxicity. These results indicate that these inhibitory peptides function through a sequence-specific mechanism and are not merely cytotoxic.
Membrane fusion by both class I and II viral fusion proteins is initiated by interaction of the fusion peptide with the target cell membrane. In class I viral fusion proteins, a subsequent rearrangement of a trimer of the proteins, each with two α helices, to form a six-helix bundle brings the viral and cell membranes into closer proximity. Inhibitors of viruses with class I fusion proteins, such as Fuzeon™ that mimic a portion of one or the other of the two α helices, interfere with a step proximal to six-helix bundle formation possibly by forming an inactive aggregate with the opposite helix. Recent studies indicate that after insertion of the fusion peptide, class II viral fusion proteins likewise undergo rearrangements. In this case, intraprotein interactions may occur between the stem domain and domains I, II and/or III [21-28,46]. According to this model, the viral and cellular membranes are brought closer by interactions of the stem with other portions of E, resulting in bilayer fusion. DN59, WN53 and WN83 peptides may interfere with the intramolecular interactions between the stem and other portions of class II viral fusion proteins, a possibility suggested previously [23,24,46].
Two of the inhibitory peptides (WN53 and WN83) are designed from overlapping regions of the E protein domain I/II junction and are specifically inhibitory against WNV. Recently, other investigators have hypothesized that small molecule inhibitors to this domain I/II junction region might be developed. Modis et al (2003; 2004) predicted that interactions near this region (the k-l loop) that are involved in the rotational changes between these domains might be blocked by small molecule inhibitors. However, our similar peptides designed from the analogous region of the DENV E protein (D57 and D81) failed to inhibit DENV infectivity.
The possibility that WN53, WN83 and DN59 interact with some target cell surface component to exert their inhibitory effects cannot be ruled out. However, the majority of flavivirus neutralizing antibodies that appear to be involved in receptor blocking bind to domain III, and soluble domain III itself can block flavivirus entry, apparently through competition for cellular receptors [47-51]. In contrast, the domains that correspond to WN53, WN83 and DN59 peptides, IIb and the pre-anchor stem, appear to be involved in structural rearrangements during fusion, rather than direct interactions with cellular receptors. Interestingly, previous observations indicate that some monoclonal antibodies block virion entry at a post attachment step, indicating that they may interfere with conformational changes necessary for fusion [52]. That possibility that some antibodies can gain access to regions important for conformational changes and block these changes suggests that these inhibitory peptide regions might be candidates for novel vaccine designs that either utilize the inhibitory peptide regions directly as antigens, or target the regions that interact with the inhibitory peptides. Further studies are needed to define the exact mechanism of inhibition of these DENV and WNV peptides, and the specific nature or location of their interactions with viral targets.
The DN59 peptide is inhibitory against DENV as well as WNV. The corresponding pre-anchor region is highly conserved between DENV and WNV as well as among other flaviviruses (Table 2) and probably functions in a similar manner during entry of all flaviviruses [53]. Thus, DN59 or similar peptides may act as broad-spectrum flavivirus inhibitors. Other flaviviruses considered potential bioterrorism agents, including JEV, Kyasanur Forest disease virus and TBEV, may also be inhibited by DN59, a DN59 derivative, or by an analogous peptide. Unlike proposed DENV vaccines, which must be multivalent (ie. simultaneously effective against each of the four DENV serotypes because of the phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement), peptide drugs targeting the highly conserved stem conserved motifs in flavivirus E may demonstrate cross-strain efficacy.
IC50s in the μM range have been considered promising for class I viral fusion protein inhibitor development [54,55]. Thus, the peptides identified here can serve as lead compounds that may be developed as peptide drugs against the four serotypes of DENV, WNV and potentially other flaviviruses. We anticipate that such peptide inhibitors may be as successful as the HIV-1 inhibitory peptide Fuzeon™. Unlike persistant HIV infections, immune responses against DENV and other flaviviruses are capable of clearing the viruses in individuals that survive the initial infection. By reducing the viral load during the initial stages of infection, it may be possible to extend the window of time during which an immune response could arise, and thus enable more individuals to control, eliminate and survive infections by these agents. Evidence for the ability to therapeutically intervene in flavivirus-induced diseases has been demonstrated with the recent observation that administration of neutralizing antibodies against WNV can be curative, even after symptom initiation [56]. Development of resistant mutants will be a concern, but should be a less problematic than in the case of long-term treatment of persistent retroviral infections.
It is worth noting that the HIV inhibitor Fuzeon™, was initially identified using a predictive strategy without the availability of structural data [6,7,57]. The fact that we developed these peptides using a predictive algorithm validates our approach as well as the accuracy of the flavivirus E protein structural data. A similar approach may be useful for the large number of other viruses with class II envelope fusion proteins with or without known structures.
Sequences of DENV and WNV E with positive Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale scores were determined using the program Membrane Protein eXplorer [1]. After consideration of the known secondary structures for several subdomains of E, selected peptides were synthesized by solid-phase conventional N-α-9-flurenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry (Genemed Synthesis, San Francisco, CA). Peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. Peptide stock solutions were prepared in 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): 80% (v/v) H20, and concentrations determined by absorbance of aromatic side chains at 280 nm. Scrambled peptides sequences were obtained by drawing from a hat.
DENV strain New Guinea-2 and WNV strain Egypt 101 were obtained from R. Tesh at the World Health Organization Arbovirus Reference Laboratory at the University of Texas at Galveston. DENV and WNV were propagated in the African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line, LLCKM-2, a gift of K. Olsen at Colorado State University. Sindbis virus (SINV) containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) protein expression cassette was obtained from K. Ryman at Louisiana State University at Shreveport and was propagated in baby hamster kidney cells. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, at 37°C with 5% (v/v) CO2.
LLCKM-2 target cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells in each well of a 6-well plate 48 h prior to infection. Approximately 200-focus forming units (FFU) of DENV, WNV, or SINV/EGFP were incubated with or without peptides in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at rt. Virus/peptide or virus/control mixtures were allowed to infect confluent LLCKM-2 monolayers for 1 h at 37°C, after which time the medium was removed and the cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with fresh DMEM/10% (v/v) FBS containing 0.85% (w/v) SeaPlaque Agarose (Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, ME). Cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 1 day (Sindbis virus), 3 days (WNV) or 6 days (DNV). Sindbis virus infections were quantified by directly counting green fluorescing foci. Cultures infected with DENV were fixed with 10% formalin overnight at 4°C and permeablized with 70% (v/v) ethanol prior to immunostaining and visualization using a human polyclonal anti-flavivirus antibody (a gift of V. Vorndam, CDC, San Juan) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and AEC chromogen substrate (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). WNV plaques were similarly visualized using a mouse anti-WNV antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and an HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA).
Peptide cytotoxicity was measured using the TACS™ MTT cell proliferation assay (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

39. Neutrophil elastase, an acid-independent serine protease, facilitates reovirus uncoating and infection in U937 promonocyte cells
Mammalian reoviruses are the prototypic members of the Reoviridae family, which also includes the pathogenic rotaviruses, coltiviruses, seadornaviruses and orbiviruses. These viruses share elements of their replication cycle as well as structural features, including a non-enveloped multi-layered capsid that surrounds a segmented dsRNA genome. In humans, mammalian reoviruses are typically associated with mild and self-limiting enteric and respiratory infections. However, studies in neonatal mice reveal that reoviruses can spread to distant tissue sites in immunocompromised hosts (reviewed in[1]). The factors that determine reovirus cellular host range are poorly understood. Because reovirus attaches to cells through interactions with broadly expressed receptors, one or more subsequent steps in the viral life cycle must help to regulate host range and pathogenesis. Our recent studies suggest that one such step is proteolysis of the capsid protein σ3 [2,3].
In cell culture, the first step in infection is attachment to cellular receptors through interactions with the viral protein σ1 [4,5]. σ1 interacts with two known receptors: sialic acid and junctional adhesion molecule 1 [6-8]. Following binding, virions are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis [9]. Endocytosis is an essential step in the viral life cycle under standard infection conditions [10]. Within the endosomal and/or lysosomal compartment, proteases convert virions into particles that resemble in vitro-generated intermediate subvirion particles (ISVPs) [10-14]. These uncoating intermediates, typically prepared using chymotrypsin or trypsin, lack σ3 and have a cleaved form of μ1. Studies using ISVPs and ISVPs recoated with recombinant outer capsid proteins reveal that σ3 plays a key role in regulating reovirus cell entry by interacting with, protecting, and controlling the conformational status of the underlying penetration protein μ1 [15-18]. In cells that cannot efficiently mediate σ3 degradation during uncoating, reovirus infection is slow or blocked; these cells can be productively infected by particles that lack σ3 [2]. In vitro, ISVP-like particles can be generated by a variety of proteases in addition to chymotrypsin and trypsin, including proteinase K, thermolysin, endoproteinase lys-C, Cat L, Cat B and Cat S[3,19-21].
Recent work has provided insight into the cellular determinants of reovirus uncoating. In murine fibroblasts, where reovirus entry has been best studied, the cysteine proteases Cat L, and to a lesser extent Cat B, are required for σ3 removal, whereas the aspartyl protease Cat D is not [14,21-25]. Virion disassembly in murine fibroblasts also requires acidic pH[10,26,27]. Recently, we demonstrated that reovirus uncoating in the macrophage-like cell line P388D is mediated by the acid-independent lysosomal cysteine protease Cat S[3]. This finding revealed that in different cell types, distinct proteases can facilitate reovirus uncoating. Our results suggested a model in which infection in some cells is acid-dependent because the proteases that mediate σ3 removal in those cells require acidic pH for maximal activity. Thus, in fibroblasts or other cells in which the acid-dependent proteases Cat L and Cat B mediate σ3 removal, infection is acid-dependent [21,23,28], whereas in Cat S-expressing cells it is not [3], because Cat S maintains its activity at neutral pH [29]. Insight from the analysis of reovirus cell entry facilitated the recent discovery that activation of the Ebola virus glycoprotein also depends on the activity of the acid-dependent endosomal proteases Cat B and Cat L [30].
The role that specific intracellular and extracellular proteases play in regulating reovirus tropism, spread, and disease in animals is largely unknown, except in the murine intestinal tract where pancreatic serine proteases have been shown to mediate σ3 removal [31,32]. Reovirus also naturally infects hosts via the respiratory tract [33-35]. One protease with well-described effects in the respiratory tract is elastase 2 (GenBank NM_001972), an inflammatory serine protease of the chymotrypsin family, which is predominantly expressed by neutrophils [36]. NE plays a prominent role in wound repair [37-39] and in controlling microbial infections [38-40]. NE expression can also promote pathogenesis; it has been implicated in smoke-induced emphysema [41], respiratory syncytial viral bronchiolitis [42] and in the respiratory syndrome ARDS [4]. The fact that reovirus replication in the rodent lung causes an influx of neutrophils [35,43] and that reovirus infection can recapitulate ARDS [44], led us to ask whether NE could mediate productive reovirus uncoating. We investigated reovirus infection in the monocyte-like cell line U937, because it is known to express NE [45]. Experiments described in this report demonstrate that reovirus infection in U937 cells does not require cysteine protease activity and is not blocked in the presence of agents that raise vesicular pH. Studies using protease inhibitors suggest that, in the absence of cysteine protease activity, NE is largely responsible for productive infection of U937 cells. NE can directly mediate σ3 removal from reovirus virions; the resultant particles are infectious and do not require additional intracellular proteolysis. Our data raise the possibility that NE is involved in reovirus replication in the respiratory tract.
The promonocytic cell line U937 expresses large amounts of elastase [45] and provided a suitable system to analyze the role of this protease in reovirus infection. To determine if NE can facilitate reovirus infection of U973 cells, we first established conditions under which lysosomal cysteine protease activity was inhibited. Cells were treated with 300 μM E64, a broad-spectrum cysteine protease inhibitor [46], and protease activity was assessed using the Cat L and Cat B-specific fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA. We analyzed enzyme activity at two time points: first after 3 h of treatment, because we typically pre-treat cells with inhibitors for 3 h prior to infection, and second at 3 d, the time point at which viral yield would be quantified. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with 300 μM E64 completely abolished cysteine protease activity in U937 cells. Consistent with our previous findings [3], E64 also completely blocked cysteine protease activity in L929 cells. Raw values are provided, to illustrate the relative difference in Cat L/B enzyme activity levels between U937 cells and L929 fibroblasts. In the absence of inhibitor, Cat L and B activity was significantly lower in U937 cells than in L929 cells. This may be a consequence of high expression in U937 cells of cystatin F, an intracellular cysteine protease inhibitor with specificity for Cat L and papain [47].
Next, we compared reovirus replication in E64-treated U937 and L929 cells. Cells were pre-treated for 3 h and infected with Lang virions or ISVPs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 1B. In the absence of E64, both L929 and U937 cells supported reovirus replication, consistent with the fact that these cells express Cat L. As expected, E64 blocked virion infection of L929 cells; however, viral yields in E64-treated U937 cells were only slightly reduced relative to untreated cells. ISVPs, which lack capsid protein σ3, replicated efficiently in treated cells, indicating that 300 μM E64 was not toxic to either cell type. These results demonstrate that productive infection of U937 cells by Lang virions does not require the activity of E64-sensitive, papain-like cysteine proteases.
Acidic pH is required for productive reovirus infection of murine L929 fibroblasts [10,27], in which the acid-dependent proteases Cat L and Cat B mediate uncoating [21,23]. Serine proteases, including NE, and metalloproteases function over a broader pH range. Therefore, to gain insight into the nature of the protease(s) that can promote reovirus uncoating in U937 cells, we investigated the requirements for acidic pH. L929 and U937 cells were left untreated or pre-treated with E64 in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1 (Baf) or NH4Cl. These latter agents raise vesicular pH by blocking the vacuolar H+-ATPase pump or by acting as a weak base, respectively [48-50]. After pre-treatment, cells were infected with Lang virions at an MOI of 3 and viral yields were determined at 3 days post infection (d p.i.). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2. Treatment with either Baf or NH4Cl did not inhibit viral replication in U937 cells; yields reached 2.9 and 2.7 logs, respectively. Furthermore, these agents had little effect on viral replication in U937 cells even when the cells were also treated with E64 to inhibit cysteine protease activity. In contrast, Baf or NH4Cl alone completely blocked reovirus replication in L929 cells, consistent with the requirement for Cat L/B-mediated σ3 removal in these cells. Given that reovirus uncoating is an essential step in the viral life cycle [10], these findings revealed that a non-cysteine protease that functions at neutral pH can facilitate this step in U937 cells.
Treatment of the promonocytic U937 cells with phorbol ester derivatives results in their differentiation into macrophage-like cells [51,52]. This differentiation is characterized by several major phenotypic changes, including increases in expression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptors, upregulation of collagenase activity and a significant decrease in the expression of NE and Cat G [51,52]. We predicted, therefore, that PMA treatment might decrease the capacity of reovirus virions to replicate in U937 cells when cysteine proteases were inhibited. To confirm that there was a significant decrease in NE expression in U937 cells differentiated with PMA, U937 cells were treated with 150 nM PMA for 72 h and expression of NE was analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, NE was expressed in untreated U937 cells, but its expression was dramatically reduced following PMA-induced differentiation.
To examine the effect of U937 cell differentiation on reovirus infection, PMA-treated and untreated U937 cells were left untreated or were treated with E64 for 3 h and infected with Lang virions or ISVPs at an MOI of 3. Yields were measured at 3 d p.i. and the results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 3B. In the absence of E64, PMA-treated U937 cells were permissive to infection by virions. PMA treatment only decreased yields by ~0.5 log relative to untreated cells. In contrast, when PMA-differentiated U937 cells were treated with E64 to inhibit cysteine protease activity, they no longer supported productive infection by Lang virions. Because these results could be explained if E64 was toxic to PMA-treated U937 cells, we examined the replication of ISVPs. In the presence of E64, ISVPs replicated to high yields in both undifferentiated and differentiated U937 cells. Since PMA-induced differentiation of U937 cells caused a substantial decrease in NE expression, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that NE or another similarly regulated neutral protease facilitates productive reovirus infection in promonocytic (pre-differentiated) U937 cells.
We directly examined the capacity of NE to facilitate reovirus infection by using the irreversible elastase inhibitor, N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone [53]. This inhibitor is highly specific for NE and does not inhibit the activity of the related serine protease, Cat G [53]. First, we established the efficacy and specificity of inhibitor treatment under our experimental conditions. U937 cells were treated with the NE inhibitor, E64, Baf or NH4Cl for either 3 h or 2 d and the activity of NE in cell lysates was examined using a colorimetric substrate. As shown in Table 1, the NE inhibitor was active at both time points. In cells treated with the specific inhibitor, NE activity was less than 9% of that in untreated U937 cells. In contrast, in U937 cells treated with E64, Baf or NH4Cl, NE activity was only modestly reduced, remaining above 80% even after 2 d. These results are consistent with the capacity of NE to function at neutral pH. To verify the specificity of the NE inhibitor, we also examined its effect on Cat L/B activity using the fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA. As expected, Cat L/B activity was completely inhibited by E64 but largely unaffected by the NE inhibitor.
To examine the effect of the NE inhibitor on reovirus replication in U937 cells, we pre-treated them for 3 h with E64 in the presence or absence of the NE inhibitor, infected them with Lang virions or ISVPs at an MOI of 3, and quantified viral yields at 2 d p.i. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4. Consistent with the results shown in Fig 1, virion replication was not blocked in E64-treated U937 cells. However, in the presence of both E64 and the NE inhibitor, yields were significantly reduced. ISVPs replicated to high yields in treated cells, indicating that the combination of inhibitors was not toxic to U937 cells. These results demonstrate that NE plays a critical role in reovirus infection of U937 cells when cysteine proteases are inhibited.
NE, like many cellular proteases, is expressed as a proenzyme that becomes activated only after its pro-region is removed [54]. We envisioned two models by which NE could facilitate reovirus infection of U937 cells. In the first, NE could directly mediate σ3 degradation, leading to the generation of an ISVP-like particle. In the second, NE could act indirectly by activating another protease. To try to distinguish between these models, we examined the capacity of purified NE to directly mediate σ3 removal from Lang virions in vitro. Purified Lang virions were treated with NE for 1 and 4 h and the treated virus particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 5A, NE efficiently removed σ3 from Lang virions; after 1 h very little intact σ3 remained on viral particles. After 4 h of NE treatment, σ3 was completely removed and the underlying μ1C was cleaved to the δ and φ fragments (φ was not retained on the gel). When we assayed the infectivity of the resultant particles by plaque assay we found that NE treatment did not negatively affect the titer of Lang particles (data not shown).
To determine if NE-generated SVPs required further proteolytic processing of σ3, L929 cells were pre-treated with E64 to block cysteine protease activity and infected at an MOI of 3 with Lang virions, ISVPs or NE-generated subviral particles (NE-SVPs). Viral yields were determined at 1 d p.i. As expected, E64 blocked infection of L929 cells by virions. In contrast, both ISVPs and NE-SVPs replicated efficiently in the presence of the cysteine protease inhibitor (Fig. 5B). Because virion disassembly in L929 cells requires acidic pH [10], we also examined the capacity of NE-SVPs to infect L929 cells treated with Baf, NH4Cl or monensin, three agents that raise vesicular pH by distinct mechanisms. Cells were treated with these agents and then infected with virions, ISVPs or NE-SVPs at an MOI of 10. At 18 hours post infection (h p.i.), cell lysates were harvested and expression of the reovirus non-structural protein μNS was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5C). As expected, when treated cells were infected with virions, viral protein expression was blocked. In contrast, μNS expression was evident even in the presence of agents that raise pH when infections were initiated with ISVPs or NE-SVPs (Fig. 5C). Together, these results demonstrate that NE can directly mediate σ3 removal from virions to generate infectious particles that do not require further proteolytic processing by acid-dependent cysteine proteases in L929 cells.
Serine proteases are involved in reovirus infection in the mammalian intestinal tract [31] and in this report we provide evidence that they can mediate uncoating and promote infection in U937 cells. This expands the range of proteases that promote reovirus infection in cell culture to include NE as well as the cysteine proteases Cat L, Cat B, and Cat S. Several lines of evidence now support the notion that protease expression is a cell-specific host factor that can impact reovirus infection. For example, some reovirus strains are inefficiently uncoated by Cat S and thus do not replicate to high yield in P388D macrophages [3]. In this report we demonstrate that PMA-induced differentiation influences the type of protease that mediates reovirus uncoating in U937 cells. In these cells, PMA treatment is reported to increase Cat L expression [55] and decrease expression of the serine proteases NE and Cat G [56,57]. Accordingly, when we used PMA to induce U937 cell cultures to differentiate, reovirus infection became sensitive to the cysteine protease inhibitor E64. We suspect that Cat L is largely responsible for uncoating in these PMA-differentiated cells, but the acid-independent protease Cat S may also play a role. We are currently addressing this question by analyzing infection in PMA-differentiated cells treated with either Baf or NH4Cl.
Our data do not completely resolve this question. Cat G is expressed by U937 cells and, like NE, it is down-regulated by PMA treatment. Furthermore, we found that in vitro treatment of reovirus virions with purified Cat G generates SVPs that behave like NE-SVPs in that they are infectious in the absence of further proteolytic processing (data not shown). Results of our experiment with the NE-specific inhibitor suggest that NE is largely responsible for the E64-resistant infection in U937 cells. While this inhibitor is reported not to inhibit Cat G [53], we have not independently confirmed this. Another approach to assess the role of Cat G in reovirus infection of U937 cells would be to examine the effect of Cat G-specific inhibitors on infection. We tried one such inhibitor, Cathepsin G Inhibitor I (Calbiochem)[58], but found that it was cytotoxic to U937 cell cultures. Given that both NE and Cat G can generate infectious reovirus SVPs, more work needs to be done in order to understand the role that these two proteases play in infection in these cells.
Previously, we reported that virion uncoating mediated by Cat S does not require acidic pH [3]. These results were consistent with the acid-independence of Cat S activity [37]. Together, the results in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 reveal that, like Cat S, NE-mediates infection in an acid-independent manner. This finding thus provides further support for a model in which the requirement for acidic pH during reovirus infection of some cell types reflects the requirement for acid-dependent protease activity in those cells rather than some other requisite acid-dependent aspect of cell entry. The small effect of Baf and NH4Cl on E64-resistant reovirus growth (Fig. 2) may reflect the participation of one or more acid-dependent proteases (such as Cat D) in the activation of NE.
Elastase is stored in azurophilic granules that are the major source of acid-dependent hydrolases in neutrophils [59]. Although these granules do not contain LAMP-1 or LAMP-2 [60] they contain the lysosomal markers LAMP-3 [61] and CD68 [62] and are accessible to endocytosed fluid-phase markers under conditions of cellular stimulation [63]. NE can be released from neutrophils during degranulation [64] and its cell surface expression can be induced upon PMA treatment [65]. However, studies in U937 cells have shown that NE is predominantly retained intracellularly and that little if any activity is present in the extracellular medium [45]. Consistent with this, we have been unable to generate ISVP-like particles by treatment of virions with U937 culture supernatants (data not shown). This observation, together with our finding that PMA treatment decreases the capacity of E64-treated U937 cells to support reovirus infection, leads us to favor a model in which NE-mediated virion uncoating in U937 cell cultures occurs intracellularly.
In vivo, a number of viruses, including dengue and respiratory syncytial virus, induce the release of IL-8, a cytokine that serves as a chemoattractant for neutrophils and promotes their degranulation [66,67]. Reovirus replication in the rat lung results in neutrophilic invasion [35,43] and studies in cell culture indicate that reovirus infection can induce IL-8 expression [68]. Thus, the capacity of reovirus to induce IL-8 secretion in vivo might facilitate the release of neutrophilic lysosomal hydrolases, including NE, into the extracellular milieu. In this report, we have shown that mammalian reovirus can utilize this acid-independent serine protease for uncoating. Our data suggest that, in vivo, one consequence of reovirus-induced IL-8 expression would be the generation of infectious NE-SVPs. Like ISVPs, these particles would be predicted to have an expanded cellular host range because they can infect cells that restrict intracellular uncoating [2]. Thus, inflammation might be predicted to exacerbate reovirus infection by promoting viral spread. Future studies using mice with deletions in the NE gene will be required to elucidate the role this protease plays during reovirus infection in the respiratory tract and other tissues. Finally, given the recent finding that endosomal proteolysis of the Ebola virus glycoprotein is necessary for infection [30], our results raise the interesting possibility that NE or other neutrophil proteases may play a role in cell entry of other viruses.
Murine L929 cells were maintained as suspension cultures as described previously [Kedl, 1995 #94]. U937 cells were maintained in RPMI medium (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented to contain 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco-BRL), 50-units/ml penicillin (GIBCO-BRL), 50 μg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO-BRL) and 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO-BRL). Where indicated, U937 cells were differentiated by treatment with 150 nM of PMA (Sigma) for 48 h prior to infection.
Third-passage lysate stocks of reovirus were prepared in L929 cell cultures. Purified virions were prepared by CsCl density gradient centrifugation of extracts from cells infected with third-passage lysate stocks [Furlong, 1988 #81]. ISVPs were prepared by treating purified virions with chymotrypsin as described elsewhere [Nibert, 1992 #95].
Cysteine protease activity was measured as described previously [23] with some minor modifications. Briefly, P388D U937 and L929 cells (2 × 106 each) were incubated in the presence or absence of 300 μM E-64, 5 nM LHVS, or 5 μM CA074 for the times indicated. After incubation, cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation at 179 × g for 10 min at 4°C and washed once in PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mM sodium acetate [pH 5.5], 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100), incubated on ice for 30 min and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 89 × g for 10 min at 4°C. For each sample, 20 μl of clarified cell lysate was added to 80 μl of reaction buffer (100 mM sodium acetate [pH 5.5], 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM dithiothreitol) in a well of a black 96-well plate (Corning). To measure Cat B activity, 100 μM Z-Arg-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Arg-Arg MCA) (Calbiochem) was included in the reaction buffer. To measure Cat L and Cat B activity, 100 μM Z-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Phe-Arg-MCA) (Calbiochem) was added to the reaction buffer. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle tapping every 10 min. Fluorescence was measured using an FL600 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) with an excitation of 390 nm and emission at 460 nm.
NE activity was determined by incubating 3 × 106 U937 cells in the presence or absence of 200 μM NE inhibitor (N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone) (Sigma) for the indicated times. After treatment, cells were collected by centrifugation at 179 × g for 10 min at 4°C, washed twice in PBS and lysed in TLB (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 2.5 mM MgCλ2, 100 NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 μg/μl of leupeptin [Sigma], 1 mM PMSF) for 30 m on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 89 × g for 10 min at 4°C. For each sample, 20 μl of cell lysate was added to 80 μl of virion dialysis buffer (VDB) (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.5]) containing 500 μM of NE substrate (MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA) (Calbiochem) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle tapping every 10 min. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an EL340 BioTek microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments).
Cells were infected (in triplicate) at the indicated MOI and adsorption was allowed to proceed for 1 h on ice at 4°C. After adsorption, cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in fresh media. Virus and cells were then added to dram vials (2 × 105 cells/vial) containing 1 ml of chilled medium. Prior to infection, some cells were pre-treated for 3 h with 300 μM E64 and/or 25 nM Baf (Sigma), 20 mM NH4Cl (Sigma) and 200 μM NE inhibitor. Inhibitors were included in the medium throughout the time course for treated samples. Time zero samples were immediately frozen at -20°C and remaining samples were incubated at 37°C until the desired time point was reached. Samples were frozen and thawed three times and titrated by plaque assay on L929 cells as described elsewhere [69]. Viral yields were calculated according to the following formula: log10(PFU/ml)t = x hr - log10 (PFU/ml)t = 0 +/- standard deviation (SD).
NE digestions were performed as follows. Purified virions (7.5 × 1010) were incubated with 25 μg/ml of purified NE (Calbiochem) in 20 μL VDB at 37°C for the times indicated. Mock-treated samples were incubated in VDB for the longest time point. 1 mM PMSF and 200 μM of NE inhibitor were added to the samples to terminate the reactions. Protein sample buffer (0.125 M Tris [pH 8.0], 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% sucrose, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to each reaction mixture and samples were resolved on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. The protein gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.
To analyze NE expression, cell lysates were generated from U937 cells, either treated or untreated for 48 h with 150 nM PMA as described for the analysis of viral protein expression. Lysate from the equivalent of 1 × 106 cells was run on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked overnight in TBST containing 10% nonfat dry milk. NE expression was analyzed using a polyclonal antibody against NE (1:400 in TBST) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA). Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:5000 in TBST). Bound antibody was detected by treating the nitrocellulose filters with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham) and exposing them to Full Speed Blue X-ray film (Henry Schein, Melville, NY).
Cells were plated at 106/well in a 6-well plate 18–24 h prior to infection. Virus was allowed to adsorb to cells for 1.5 h at 4°C. At this temperature, virus binds to cells but is not internalized [70]. After adsorption, the cultures were incubated at 37°C in fresh medium. Prior to some infections, cells were pre-treated for 3 h with 300 μM E64, 100 nM Baf, 25 μM monensin (Sigma), or 20 mM NH4Cl. In those instances inhibitors were also included in the post-adsorption culture medium. At the indicated times p.i., cells were collected by centrifugation at 179 × g, washed twice in chilled PBS and lysed in TLB. After centrifugation at 179 × g to remove cellular debris, samples were resuspended in sample buffer. Protein samples (representing 1 × 105 cells) were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 100 V in 25 mM Tris-192 mM glycine-20% methanol. Nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) were blocked overnight at 4°C in TBST (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, rinsed with TBST, and incubated with a rabbit anti-μNS polyclonal antiserum [71] (1:12500 in TBST) for 1 h. Membranes were subsequently washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunogloblin G (IgG) (1:7500 in TBST) (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.). Bound antibody was detected by treating the nitrocellulose filters with enhanced chemilumescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham) and exposing the filters to Full Speed Blue X-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.).
Purified virions (1.4 × 1011) were incubated with 25 μg/ml of purified neutrophil elastase (Calbiochem) in 40 μL of VDB at 37°C for 3 h. Reactions were terminated by adding 1 mM PMSF and 200 μM NE inhibitor to the reaction mixture. 5.0 × 1010 particles were run on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to confirm the removal of σ3. Viral infectivity was determined by plaque assay on L929 cell monlayers.
Purified Lang virions (1.4 × 1011) were treated with 25 μg/ml of NE in 40 μL of VDB at 37°C for the times indicated. Reactions were terminated as described above. To verify σ3 removal, the proteins from 5.0 × 1010 particles were separated on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Viral infectivity for each time point was determined by plaque assay on L929 cell monolayers.

40. Appropriate Models for the Management of Infectious Diseases
The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the significance attached to infectious diseases from the public health perspective. This trend is due in part to the emergence of new and highly pathogenic infections such as Ebola [1], West Nile virus [2], and SARS [3]. There are also well-publicized concerns surrounding the deliberate introduction of pathogens as bioterrorism weapons [4,5], and the continued persistence and resurgence of older infections, several of which now boast strains resistant to more than one drug [6]. In addition, there have been a number of high-profile and economically expensive disease outbreaks in domestic livestock [7–9] as well as wildlife populations [10].
The effective management and control of such infections is increasingly done with substantial input from mathematical models, which are used not only to provide information on the nature of the infection itself, through estimates of key parameters such as the basic reproductive ratio R
0 [11], but also to make predictions about the likely outcome of alternative courses of action [12–15]. During the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, for example, the former UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food set up a committee that included two groups with expertise in mathematical modeling of disease dynamics. It is becoming increasingly important, therefore, that epidemiological models produce accurate quantitative predictions, and this in turn relies on accurate parameterization. Here, we examine the dynamical consequences of an unrealistic yet almost ubiquitous assumption embedded in such models concerning the distribution of the latent and infectious periods. In particular, we show that without greater care in model formulation, we may risk systematic biases when parameterizing models from data and may make overly optimistic policy recommendations.
The most commonly used framework for epidemiological systems, is still the susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) class of models, in which the host population is categorized according to infection status as either susceptible, infectious, or recovered [16,17]. Subsequent refinements of the model have incorporated an additional exposed (infected but not yet infectious) class (susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered [SEIR] models) (see Protocol S1 for mathematical equations). One of the fundamental mathematical assumptions in such models is that the rate of leaving the exposed or infectious class is constant, irrespective of the period already spent in that class. While mathematically very convenient, this assumption gives rise to exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods, which is epidemiologically unrealistic for most infections [18–20]. A more sensible formulation would be to specify the probability of leaving a class as a function of the time spent within the class, such that initially the chance of leaving the class is small, but the probability increases as the mean infectious/latent period is reached. This would give rise to a more realistic distribution of latent and infectious periods, with a stronger central tendency. A convenient way to describe such distributions is to write an expression for the infectious class (neglecting the latent class for this example) as follows:



which translates mathematically into



where β is the infection transmission rate and N is the total population size. The probability of remaining infectious through time is governed by the survivorship function, P(t), and as such the average infectious period, denoted by 1/γ, is given by  [21]. The probability density function of the infectious period, p(t), is just the negative derivative of the survivorship function, −dP(t)/dt. Different functional forms for p(t) give rise to alternative assumptions concerning the distribution of the infectious period in the model. For example, setting p(t) equal to e−γt/γ recovers the classical exponentially distributed SIR model. More realistic distributions can be obtained by choosing p(t) to be a gamma probability density function [22–27], with parameters γ and n (see Protocol S1). An alternative (and computationally efficient) means of modeling infections with gamma distributions is to divide the infectious class into n subclasses with nγ being the rate of sequential progression through the subclasses. The advantage of this formalism is that when n = 1 we recover the exponentially distributed model, which has a large variance, while as n→∞ we obtain a fixed infectious period. The effects of n on the distribution of the infectious period are demonstrated in Figure 1A; in Table 1 we present some examples of latent and infectious period distributions estimated from data.

The dynamical consequences of these differences in the distribution of infectious and latent periods have received some attention over the past two decades. It has been shown, for example, that the precise distribution of the infectious period has no qualitative effects on the asymptotic values or properties of the system [21,24], though perturbations to the endemic equilibrium take longer to die out as n increases [22,26]. When contact rates vary seasonally, for example, to mimic the aggregation of children in schools [28,29], changes in p(t) are known to have important consequences for the persistence likelihood of infections [25,26,30]. An issue that has received surprisingly little attention, despite its obvious applicability to emerging infections and possible “deliberate exposure,” is the influence of latent and infectious period distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible population. This is in contrast to the conceptually similar situation of within-host dynamics of viral disease, such as HIV, for which some models already adopt realistic distributions to describe stages in the cell life cycle [31,32]. In particular, Lloyd [33] has shown how parameter estimates made from viral load data are affected by different assumptions about these distributions. Here we are interested in the application of this work to between-host transmission dynamics. As can be seen in Figure 1B, changes in the gamma distribution parameter n have substantial quantitative consequences for the epidemic curve: in comparison to a gamma-distributed model, the epidemic given by the exponentially distributed model (i) takes off at a dramatically slower rate, (ii) predicts a significantly smaller (approximately 56%) peak number of cases, and (iii) lasts much longer (almost twice as long).
Whether these marked differences between alternate model formulations may translate into potentially important public health concerns is a key question, which we address in two ways. First, we document systematic differences in the model parameters estimated from an epidemic using the exponential and gamma-distributed models. Second, we demonstrate that the use of exponential models produces overoptimistic predictions about the low levels of control required to subdue an epidemic.
During the early phase of an epidemic, the observed exponential growth rate, λ, is related to the basic reproductive ratio, R
0, of the infection. Mathematically, λ is just the dominant eigenvalue of the disease-free equilibrium, and one can show that λ must satisfy



for the SEIR model with gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods (further details are given in Protocol S1). This equation translates into an expression for R
0 in terms of λ and the other parameters, as is presented in equation 4. Therefore, if we can estimate the growth rate λ from data, we can use equation 4 to obtain an estimate of R
0.
To study the effects of contact tracing and isolation, we modify the assumptions of the SEIR epidemic model, while still incorporating gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods. In the new model, isolation of newly infectious cases occurs at a daily rate of dI after a delay of τD days, which represents a period when infected individuals are infectious but asymptomatic or undetectable (IA). A fraction q of those who had contact with an infectious and symptomatic individual (IS) (but did not contract the infection) are removed to the quarantined susceptible class, SQ, where they spend exactly τQ days. An identical fraction of newly exposed individuals is also quarantined. Full details of the model equations are given in Protocol S1.
We may obtain an estimate for R
0 by calculating the initial growth rate (λ) of an infection from data and equating it to the growth rate of the equations, calculated from the dominant eigenvalue of the disease-free equilibrium (see Methods). Such an exercise reveals that for any observed λ, the precise value of R
0 estimated is crucially dependent on the fundamental assumptions made concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods. Specifically, we find that the following equation determines the relationship between R
0 and an empirically estimated epidemic growth rate, λ:




where m and n represent the number of subclasses in the exposed and infectious categories, respectively. The mean latent and infectious periods are represented by 1/σ and 1/γ, respectively, and are assumed to be known or estimated from independent data. This relationship was first determined by Anderson and Watson [36] and has recently been applied in the context of viral life cycle dynamics by Lloyd [33].
The relationship between estimated R
0 and the distributions of the latent and infectious periods is demonstrated in Figure 2A. It reveals a subtle yet very important interaction between model structure and estimated R
0. In general, as the infectious period becomes more tightly distributed (increasing n), lower values of R
0 are estimated for any given growth rate λ. On the other hand, as the variance in the latent period is reduced (increasing m), higher values of R
0 are estimated. Indeed, we may use the relationship given by equation 4 to arrive at the following general principle: if we ignore the latent period, then models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will always overestimate the infection's basic reproductive ratio. When the latent period is included, however, this finding is reversed when the growth rate is large (Figure 2B). In closely examining equation 4, we note that the basic reproductive ratio estimated from a model without an exposed class (1/σ = 0) is always lower than the estimate from the corresponding model when a latent period is included (1/σ > 0) (see equation S1 in Protocol S1). Therefore, when faced with a rapidly spreading infection, either entirely ignoring the latent period or assuming exponential distributions will lead to an underestimate of R
0 and therefore will underestimate the level of global control measures (such as mass vaccination) that will be needed to control the epidemic.
While the results described in the previous section are based on the rate of epidemic take-off, we reach the same qualitative conclusions about the effects of the distributions of latent and infectious periods when estimating R
0 by other data-fitting methods. For illustration, we use data from an influenza outbreak in an English boarding school [37] to estimate model parameters by trajectory matching. In the absence of independent data, this method can be used to provide estimates of the key infectious parameters. Of course, here we can also compare the parameter estimates to observed parameter ranges, since the influenza virus is known to have a latent period of between 1 and 4 d and infected individuals may transmit the virus up to 4 or 5 d after the onset of illness [38]. We determine the best fit of the model output to daily incidence data by minimizing the least squares errors for different values of the distribution parameters m and n. For comparison, we also determine the best-fit parameters in the absence of any latent period. The least squares errors and estimated R
0 of the best fit for a combination of m and n are presented in Figure 3. These results clearly illustrate the points raised in the previous section: (i) entirely ignoring the latent period gives a significantly lower estimate of R
0, and (ii) the assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods results in consistently lower estimates of R
0 than their gamma-distributed counterparts.
Despite visually similar solutions, the SIR best-fit and SEIR best-fit models (Figure 3C) result in strikingly different estimates of R
0: 3.74 for the SIR model versus 35.9 for the SEIR model, which is partly a result of the small population size. However, the best-fit estimate of R
0 obtained from the gamma-distributed SEIR model (m = 2, n = 2) is much more sensitive to the number of points used to obtain the fit (Figure 3D): the exponentially distributed SIR model gives the same estimate whether the first six (up to the peak in incidence) or more points are used. This difference is further emphasized if we use the first few points of the data to estimate the rate of epidemic take-off (λ = 1.0837 d−1), and then take the final estimates of the average latent and infectious periods to compute R
0 using equation 4. For the SIR model (n = 1, 1/γ = 2.2 d) we obtain an R
0 of 4.38 whereas for the SEIR model (m = 2, n = 2, 1/σ = 2.6 d, 1/γ = 2.1 d) we obtain an R
0 of 16.9. Thus the initial rate of increase in incidence does well in estimating R
0 for the exponentially distributed SIR model but significantly less well for the gamma-distributed SEIR model. Given that we are fitting an additional parameter, it is to be expected that a limited number of data points confounds the estimation of R
0 when we include a latent period in the model assumptions. However, this also highlights that even when incorporating a latent period, estimates of R
0 based on the initial epidemic growth rate may potentially underestimate the true value of R
0.
The results outlined above highlight the pitfalls of making a priori assumptions concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods when estimating parameters. Depending on the precise details, inappropriate model selection may give rise to either gross over- or underestimates for the basic reproductive ratio of an infection. However, even when parameter estimates are reliable, choice of model structure can also be very important when making recommendations concerning individual-level control strategies. Historically, it has been shown that contact tracing and the effective quarantine of infected individuals and those potentially exposed is an important means of infection management [13,39,40]. We introduce both these measures into the SEIR epidemic model, assuming that there is a small delay in detecting newly infectious individuals, which may represent an asymptomatic phase or uncertainty in diagnosing symptoms (see Methods and Protocol S1). As we show in Figure 4, the precise levels of isolation of infected individuals and of quarantining contacts required to control the outbreak and the predicted level of disease incidence are crucially affected by whether the classic exponentially distributed SEIR model or a more realistic framework is used.
The process of isolating infected individuals results in a reduction in the mean infectious period (see Protocol S1). It is much more effective when the infectious period is exponentially distributed because it essentially truncates the tail of the distribution, so that the infectious period of a few individuals is dramatically reduced. This effect is not as pronounced in the gamma-distributed models because there is less variation in the infectious periods (see Figure 1A). In the same way, a longer delay in detecting infected individuals has fewer consequences for the exponentially distributed model because during this time many individuals will have naturally left the infectious class. Under the assumption of a gamma-distributed infectious period most individuals are infectious for a minimum period of time so early detection is more important. While the predicted difference between the exponential and gamma-distributed models depends on the duration of the infectious period and the fraction of contacts traced, it is generally true that models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will give rise to overly optimistic predictions concerning the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals.
To focus on the effects of the infectious period distribution on different courses of intervention we have assumed that all those who are quarantined and exposed are detected before the end of the quarantine period and are not released back into the general population. We have also formulated a model that takes into account the distribution of the latent period during quarantine and find similar qualitative results to those shown in Figure 4. However, if the average latent period is increased relative to the fixed quarantine period and there is only a small amount of isolation of infected individuals, then the control measures are predicted to be more effective for the gamma-distributed model, because more exposed individuals in the exponentially distributed model will leave quarantine before they develop the infection.
The use of models in epidemiology dates back almost a century, and while traditional models have often been highly successful in explaining observed dynamics [17,20,28,29,41], our results show that within a strict management setting, epidemiological details can make a crucial difference. Although a body of theoretical work [25,26,30] has demonstrated the importance of incorporating realistic distributions of latent and infectious periods into models of endemic disease, few studies have considered the effects associated with making predictions for an emerging disease [42].
The large discrepancies between estimates of R
0 from the exponentially distributed and gamma-distributed fits reiterate the importance of accurately determining the precise distributions of latent and infectious periods. Although the data required for such a task are often available from post hoc analyses of epidemics they are certainly lacking for a novel emerging infection. Instead, the uncertainty surrounding assumptions about the distributions should be incorporated into quantitative predictions made from epidemiological models, especially since this may well be greater than any uncertainty that arises from noise in the data. Of course, more sophisticated fitting methods than those used in this paper exist [43–46], but if the underlying structure of the model is inappropriate, the method of parameterization is largely irrelevant.
The take home message from our work is that when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks. While some practitioners are already using the approach we advocate [3,15,34,39,47], the vast majority of applied epidemiological studies still use models that incorporate exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods. Perhaps this work points to the next steps in delivering quantitatively accurate epidemiological models.

41. An atypical RNA pseudoknot stimulator and an upstream attenuation signal for −1 ribosomal frameshifting of SARS coronavirus
The −1 ribosomal frameshifting is a translational regulation mechanism adopted by a variety of viruses to synthesize two or more proteins at a fixed ratio starting with a single translation initiation site from the same open reading frame (ORF) (1–4). In response to the programmed frameshifting signals in messenger RNA (mRNA), the ribosome is induced to move one base backward in the 5′ direction, and then continues translation in the new −1 reading frame. The ratio between the two protein products from frameshifting can be determined by the frameshift efficiency of the stimulation signals and can be a key factor for the propagation of virus within the host. It has been suggested to be a potential antiviral target for the interference of viral propagation (5).
Efficient induction of eukaryotic −1 ribosomal frameshifting requires two in cis RNA elements (1,6). The first one is a hepta-nucleotides' slippery site sequence of X XXY YYZ, where the recoding occurs. Analysis indicated X can be any three identical nucleotides whereas Y represents three A or U, and Z is A, U or C. In addition, a downstream stimulator RNA structure located 6–7 nt away from the slippery site is also needed for efficient frameshifting. This downstream RNA stimulator is usually an H-type RNA pseudoknot in which nucleotides from a hairpin loop form base pairs with single-stranded region outside the hairpin. This leads to a topology featuring two helical stems of base pairing region (stems 1 and 2) connected by two single-stranded loops (loops 1 and 2) with a quasi-continuous RNA double-helical structure. However, not all RNA pseudoknots can stimulate −1 frameshifting and non-pseudoknot RNA element has been characterized to be responsible for inducing −1 frameshifting in HIV-1 (7,8).
The reported −1 frameshift efficiency induced by different RNA pseudoknots range from 1 to 4% for Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) in plant cells to 25 and 50% for mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), respectively, in animal cells (6,9,10). There is no clear picture to correlate frameshift efficiency with a specific RNA pseudoknot stimulator. However, it is thought that resistance of a pseudoknot against deformation by a marching ribosome can cause the elongating ribosome to pause (3,11–13). This will position the A- and P-site transfer RNAs (tRNAs) over the slippery site and, thus, increases the probability for ribosome to slip its A- and P-site tRNAs in the 5′ direction by one base and resume the translation in the new reading frame. Parameters known to affect frameshift efficiency include sequence identity of the slippery site and its distance to the stimulator RNA, stability of the stimulator and interactions among the ribosome, the mRNA template and the associated tRNAs (1). Recently, the sequence identity of the spacer and the E-site tRNA have both been shown to modulate frameshift efficiency (14,15) as well. In addition, host factors have also been implicated to involve in efficiency modulation (16,17).
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory illness caused by a human coronavirus (HCV). Both SARS CoV and IBV belong to Coronaviridae (18–20). The IBV is known to use a −1 frameshifting mechanism to generate RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) crucial for viral RNA replication. The 5′ portion of the IBV genomic RNA that encodes the RdRp contains a slippery site of the sequences UUUAAAC, and is followed by an H-type RNA pseudoknot with an in-frame stop codon embedded within stem 1 of the folded pseudoknot. An elongating ribosome will fall from the viral RNA template without synthesizing RdRp if −1 frameshifting did not occur in front of this in-frame stop codon. Therefore, defining the biologically relevant mRNA secondary structure, which can regulate the −1 frameshift efficiency of the SARS CoV, may provide useful information for anti-SARS strategy. In this work, we report the identification of an atypical RNA pseudoknot of SARS CoV as an efficient RNA stimulator in promoting −1 frameshifting in vitro, and explore the role of different stem regions in-frameshift efficiency determination. In addition, we will also demonstrate that particular viral RNA sequences upstream of the slippery site possess an attenuation effect on the overall −1 frameshift efficiency. It, thus, suggests that −1 ribosomal frameshifting can be attenuated by an RNA element upstream of the slippery site in addition to being promoted by a downstream RNA stimulator.
Plasmid encoding the gene for ORF 1ab junction region of SARS CoV, pCRII-SARS12 265–13 653 was a gift from Professor Pei-Jer Chen and was used as the template for PCR cloning of the cDNA of viral RNA fragments. The p2luc reporter was a gift from Professor John Atkins at the University of Utah (21) and the pRL-SV40 vector was purchased from Promega. Forward and reverse DNA primers, respectively, carrying the SalI and BamHI restriction sites and appropriately designed annealing sequences were used for PCR amplification of the desired cDNA encoding SARS CoV viral RNAs from pCRII-SARS12 265–13 653. The amplified inserts were then sub-cloned into the SalI/BamHI sites of p2luc using standard procedures and the resulting recombinant vectors were transformed into DH5α cell for the maintenance and selection by ampicillin. Frameshifting stimulator sequences of the minimal IBV and MMTV pseudoknot were chemically synthesized. They were amplified by forward and reverse primers, respectively, containing BsrGI and BsaAI site, and ligated into the BsrGI/BsaAI site (1392/1426) of restriction enzymes treated pRL-SV40 vectors.
All of the base pairing disruption and restoration mutants were constructed by using the quick-change mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions. In contrast, PCR-based ligation approach with appropriate primers was used to assemble different chimera, which carried the attenuation signal (the sequences are available upon request), and will be described briefly. Initially, two complementary oligonucleotides containing the sense and the antisense sequences corresponding to the 3′ end and 5′ star region of the two fragments planned to be jointed were synthesized chemically. They were then used as forward (sense) or reverse (antisense) primers in combination with the corresponding reverse or forward primer carrying appropriate restriction sites to amplify the desired pre-jointed fragments from pCRII-SARS12 265–13 653. The two individual PCR products with partially overlapping sequences were then assembled by the PCR-based ligation procedure (22), and then sub-cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of p2luc vectors. The identities of all cloned and mutated genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis.
RNA transcripts spanning the SARS13 377–13 475 region of SARS CoV were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. The purified RNA of desired length was then dephosphorylated by shrimp alkaline phosphatase and 5′ end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and separated by a 12% sequencing gel. All the RNase protection experiments were performed in 50 μl reaction volumes containing 50 000–70 000 c.p.m. of 5′ end labeled RNA in the presence of RNase cleavage buffer (30 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mM EDTA and 200 mM NaCl), and 10 mM MgCl2 was included in the same buffer for RNase V1 experiments. Before the addition of probing enzymes, the RNAs were denatured by heating at 70°C for 5 min followed by instant cooling on ice and brought back to 20°C for structural mapping. The following amounts of RNases were added for each reaction: 0.0088 (1000×)–0.044 (200×) μg RNase A (USB), 0.05–10 U RNase T1 (USB), 0.5–15 U RNase T2 (USB) and 0.01–01 U RNase V1 (Amersham Pharmacia). The hydrolysis RNA ladders were obtained by the incubation of RNA in the hydrolysis buffer at 85°C for 10 min and parallel RNA sequencing products were obtained by the treatment of unfolded RNA with RNases T1 and A. They were used as markers for the assignment of guanines and pyrimidines, respectively. All the reactions were incubated at 20°C for 10 min with the exception that RNase V1 was incubated for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by phenol–chloroform extraction, and precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried by vacuum. Finally, the cleavage products were loaded into a 10% denaturing gel with different running time to resolve different parts of RNA, and visualized by using phosphorimagery.
The T7-coupled transcription/translation (TNT) system (Progema) was used for the generation of the shifted and the non-shifted protein products according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each assay, a 25 μl reaction containing 500 ng of DNA template, 12.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate and 0.8 μl of 10 μCi 35S-labeled methionine (NEN) was incubated at 30°C for 1.5 h. The samples were then resolved by 12% SDS–PAGE and exposed to PhosphorImager screen for quantification after drying. The frameshift efficiency was calculated by dividing the counts of the shifted product by sum of the counts for both shifted and non-shifted products, with correction of the methionine number in each product. Control experiments with the plasmids of 100–1000 ng produce similar results for frameshift efficiency (data not shown). For the generation of capped mRNA templates, the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Human embryonic kidney HEK-293T cells were cultured in the DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The transient expression was performed by LIPOFECTIN (Gibco BRL) transfection of 500 ng of reporter plasmids into 12-wells cultured cells. The cells were then assayed for the transient expression of the reporter gene 24 h after transfection using dual-luciferase assay of cell lysates, and normalized by β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. All the in vivo experiments were repeated three times with four to six assays for each reaction. Luciferase activity measurements for both in vitro reticulocyte lysate and in vivo transfected 293T cell lysates were performed by using the dual-luciferase™ reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions on an ABI TR 717 luminometer. Calculation of luciferase-based frameshift efficiency was performed with control plasmids to calibrate the ribosome drop-off effect as described previously (21).
Sequence alignment of the junction regions of ORF 1ab of SARS CoV and other coronaviruses indicated the existence of conserved UUUAAAC slippery site followed by a stretch of viral RNA sequences with the potential to form an H-type RNA pseudoknot (Figure 1). This region of the SARS CoV RNA genome, SARS13 369–13 520 (for residues 13 369–13 520) was thus cloned into p2luc vector to examine its −1 frameshifting activity (21). To faithfully monitor frameshift efficiency, we also arranged the terminus of the viral sequences under investigation to keep the TAA sequences in the N-terminal part of firefly luciferase ORF in frame to act as a stop codon in the presence of −1 frameshifting. This leads to premature termination of the frameshifted product and, thus, prevents the underestimation of frameshift efficiency because this manipulation can minimize the ribosome drop-off effect while translating the full-length firefly ORF (21). A different vector, pRL-SV40 was also used as the second reporter. Frameshift assay using either of the reporters indicated that the selected viral RNA sequences possess a frameshift efficiency of 60% (data not shown), which suggests that the SARS13 369–13 520 RNA contains an efficient −1 frameshifting stimulator in vitro.
Further examination of sequence contents of the SARS13 369–13 520 RNA revealed a potential stem–loop structure within the loop 2 region of this IBV-type pseudoknot. Furthermore, their primary sequences were found to be conserved among isolated SARS CoV sequences, and similar stem–loop structures were also identified in the loop 2 region of bovine coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus pseudoknot (Figure 1). To confirm the existence of the predicted atypical pseudoknot, enzymatic structure probing experiments were performed on SARS13 377–13 475 RNA and some of the results are shown in Figure 2A. As can be seen, the distribution of cleavage patterns for ribonuclease probes sensitive to single-strand region (such as RNase T2, T1 and A in lanes 7–12 of Figure 2A) is in agreement with the existence of loop regions, whereas the cleavage pattern by RNase V1 (lanes 5 and 6) that prefers cutting of duplex and stacked conformations can be localized to the three predicted stem regions (S1, S2 and S3). However, co-existence of cleavage by both RNase V1 and single-strand sensitive probes can be found for nucleotides localized to the junction region between S2 and S3. This is probably caused by a dynamic conformational equilibrium in this region as non-denaturing gel analysis suggests that the SARS13 377–13 475 RNA adopts a single conformation (data not shown). Nevertheless, these probing data are consistent with the existence of a stem conformation within the loop 2 in this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot as summarized in Figure 2B. Recently, the same S3 conformation has also been proposed and verified independently (23,24).
Disruption of the base pairing region in S3 of an atypical pseudoknot impairs −1 frameshifting stimulation activity of the SARS13 369–13 520 RNA. To define the contribution of different stem regions of this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot in the stimulation of −1 frameshifting activity, we mutated those nucleotides mapped onto form the duplex conformations. Mutants expected to disrupt a stem and those expect to reform the stem by compensatory base changes were then measured for their efficiency in promoting −1 frameshifting in vitro (Figure 3A). As shown in lanes 1–3 of Figure 3B, frameshift efficiency drops from 60% for wild-type construct to <1% for both 5′ and 3′ mutants that prevent the formation of base pairing in S1. In contrast, frameshift efficiency for the mutant with compensatory base changes to restore the base pairing scheme in S1 (lane 2 of Figure 3C) rises back to the wild-type level (55%). Similar results are observed for S2 with mutants destroying or reforming base pairs in the mapped duplex region (lanes 4 and 5 of Figure 3B and Lane 3 of Figure 3C). These experiments complement structural mapping data and strongly support the idea that it is the formation of the two typical H-type pseudoknot stems, S1 and S2, and not their sequence identities are required for efficient −1 frameshifting stimulation.
Interestingly, lower sensitivity to base pairing disruption is observed for mutants located in the mapped S3 region. Mutants with disruption of base pairing in the upper or and in the lower stem region of S3 both led to a substantial decrease in frameshift efficiency when compared with the wild-type construct (from 60 to 36 or 37%, respectively, in lanes 6 and 7 of Figure 3B). However, restoring the base pairing scheme in either portion by compensatory base changes restored frameshift efficiency to the wild-type level including the up-restoration mutant that even displays a completely different sequence composition (lanes 4 and 5 in Figure 3C), suggesting that the formation of base pairing and not the sequence contents in S3 is involved in the efficient frameshifting activity of this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot. Intriguingly, frameshift efficiency does not reduce further when more bases were mutated to disrupt all the potential base pair in S3 (lanes 8 and 9 of Figure 3B), implicating the existence of a residual frameshift activity for the remaining pseudoknot scaffold. Furthermore, a pseudoknot mutant lacking the S3 but harboring an 8 nt loop 2 possesses a frameshift efficiency of 53% (lane 10 in Figure 3B). As the topology and activity of this mutant are similar to those of the minimal IBV pseudoknot that lacks 75% of its wild-type loop 2 sequences (25), which indicates that S3 is not absolutely required for high frameshift efficiency. To rule out the possibility that the observed frameshift efficiency variation in S3 mutants is the outcome of their differences in ribosome loading efficiency of uncapped mRNA templates, separately transcribed capped mRNAs were also used to examine their in vitro frameshift efficiency as shown in Figure 3D. The data confirm the result from transcription-coupled translation approach used above, although lower frameshift efficiency for the wild-type construct is observed. Together, these data suggest that the roles of S3 in −1 frameshifting stimulation may be different from those of S1 to S2.
Recently, analysis of a SARS CoV viral RNA genome containing a longer viral construct has revealed a very different frameshift efficiency from those observed in this work (26). To resolve this issue, we constructed a series of longer viral RNA-containing reporters with stepwise extension of viral insert in the 5′ direction upstream of the slippery site and measured their frameshift efficiencies. As shown in Figure 4A, frameshift efficiency of these viral RNA constructs are all lower than that of the shorter SARS13 369–13 520 RNA construct. Analysis of these data suggested that the proximal 150 nt region upstream of the slippery site, that is, the sequences 13 222–13 368 possess most of the observed downregulation effect because addition of the other 475 nt further upstream of it (the sequences 13 222–12 748) only lead to a 2% decrease in frameshift efficiency (compare lane 7 with lane 3 of Figure 4A). Together, it argues that the SARS13 222–13 368 viral RNA may possess a signal for the attenuation of −1 frameshift efficiency.
To confirm that the decrease in frameshift efficiency is contributed by the SARS13 222–13 368 viral RNA sequence, a reporter containing a large viral insert but lacking the potential attenuation signal (sequences 13 222–13 368), SARS12 748–13 368 Δatt was constructed. This construct possesses a frameshift efficiency of 55% although much longer protein is translated upstream of the slippery site and, thus, confirming the attenuation activity of the removed domain (compare lanes 2–4 of Figure 4B). Furthermore, the downregulation effect almost disappears for a chimera construct that has the potential attenuation signal fused downstream to the pseudoknot stimulator, arguing that this attenuation signal need to be positioned upstream of the slippery site to execute its function in vitro (lane 5 of Figure 4B). To examine whether the observed downregulation effect is mediated by polypeptide encoded by the viral RNA or by the RNA itself, an ORF-shifted mutant was generated and tested for its attenuation activity. In this construct, an A residue and two U residues are separately inserted into three different positions of the SARS13 222–13 368 viral RNA to shift the reading frame, and consequently change the identity for 43 of the 50 amino acids encoded by the wild-type viral RNA sequences (Figure 5A). The result in Figure 5A indicates similar downregulation effect for this construct when compared with the wild-type construct. Taken together, these data provide strong evidences that the upstream RNA itself as well as its orientation to the slippery site are crucial for the cis downregulation effect of −1 frameshift efficiency in vitro, and the most stable structure of SARS13 222–13 368 RNA predicted by RNA structure version 4.11 (27) is presented in Figure 5B with a calculated free energy of −37.7 kcal/mol.
We also evaluated the generality of downregulation effect of this attenuation signal towards other −1 frameshifting stimulators by placing it upstream of the minimal RNA pseudoknot from IBV and MMTV, respectively (25,28) (Figure 6A). Results show this upstream attenuation sequence also downregulates −1 frameshifting promoted by RNA stimulator derived from IBV and MMTV (compare lanes 2–5 of Figure 6A). However, a weaker downregulation effect is observed when the attenuation signal is coupled to the minimal MMTV pseudoknot comparing with the minimal IBV pseudoknot. Therefore, the attenuation effect of this upstream signal can vary with the identity of the downstream stimulator. Finally, capped mRNA templates with or without the attenuation signal for the minimal IBV construct used above as well as a SARS viral construct carrying residues 12 265–13 652 and lacking any luciferase-related segment were also created to analyze their in vitro frameshift efficiencies. The results shown in Figure 6B reveal parallel results with the previous study in Figures 4A and 6A, and further rule out the involvement of ribosome loading difference in the observed attenuation effect. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such attenuation activity is not an artifact caused by the reporter system used because the inhibitory effect also functions within an all-viral context (compare lanes 2 with 3 of Figure 6B).
To evaluate the biological significance of this attenuation signal in the regulation of −1 frameshifting, we constructed several p2luc-based reporters for inserts possessing or lacking SARS13 222–13 368 viral RNA without shifting the stop codon located before firefly luciferase ORF to utilize the dual-luciferase activity to monitor frameshift efficiency in vivo (21). The in vitro frameshift efficiency of these constructs were calculated from dual-luciferase assay result of the TNT products of both plasmids (lane 1 in Figure 6C), and reveals parallel results with the frameshift efficiency reported above (lanes 2 and 3 of Figure 4A). Similarly, calculation from the in vivo dual-luciferase assay result for cells transfected with the reporter constructs indicates that the frameshift efficiency reduces almost in half in the presence of attenuation signal comparing with the one lacking the attenuation signal (lane 2 in Figure 6C). Thus, this upstream attenuation signal also functions in vivo.
The pseudoknot of short S1 with a bent helical junction such as the one in MMTV and the IBV-type pseudoknot of long S1 with a stringent length-requirement of 11 bp represent two distinct classes of frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot (25,28–30). In either case, the ability to resist deformation by the translocating ribosome is thought to determine the frameshift efficiency stimulated by a specific pseudoknot (8,11,13,31). Alternatively, optimal contacts between the activity in ribosome and the stimulator for its efficient unwinding may also play roles in pseudoknot-stimulated −1 frameshifting (32). The impairment of −1 frameshifting for mutants with the disruption of S1 or S2 in SARS CoV pseudoknot can be rationalized by the formation of two separated hairpins and the coupled destruction of pseudoknot configuration. In contrast, disruption of the base pair in S3 is expected to be less important as the long loop 2 of the IBV-type pseudoknot has been thought to play a connection role to link the two stems (25). This is consistent with the wild-type like frameshift efficiency for the mutant lacking S3 in this study. Interestingly, the minimal IBV pseudoknot lacking most of its wild-type loop 2 sequences promotes −1 frameshifting better than its wild-type counterpart (10,25), whereas reverse trend is observed here for similar study on the SARS CoV pseudoknot. However, the medium frameshift efficiency for the two IBV-type mutants generated by complete base pairing disruption of S3 in SARS CoV pseudoknot suggest that the integrity of these base pairs in S3 may contribute extra −1 frameshifting activity in a delicate manner. We also note that existences of two extra base pair in the up-restoration mutants does not further enhance frameshift efficiency, implicating only a threshold value of stability is required. Taken together, they indicate that different secondary structure compositions within the loop 2 of IBV-type pseudoknot may modulate the frameshift efficiency of this type of pseudoknot, and implicate that the frameshift efficiency might be tunable by modulation of the S3 formation in vivo. Alternatively, the formation of S3 may also serve to prevent formation of unfavorable conformations that may interfere with frameshifting process as the long loop 2 could be merely constraint imposed by the encoded amino acids required for the RdRp activity.
The atypical pseudoknot found in this work is different from those in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and HCV 229E, which also contain an additional stem essential for −1 frameshifting (33,34). The additional stem of 229E pseudoknot is formed by complementary sequences between the very long loop 2 and the 3′ end sequences following stem 2, and is probably stacked onto stem 2 to form a quasi-continuous helix of 24–25 bp. In contrast, the S3 of SARS CoV pseudoknot could stack into the bottom of S1 to form a quasi-continuous helix of 25–26 bp interrupted by two separated A-bulges. Although our mapping data cannot provide information about stacking configuration among these stems in the SARS CoV pseudoknot, helical junction geometry between S1 and S2 obviously will be coupled to the positioning of S3. As modulation of frameshift efficiency by the modification of junction geometry via tertiary interactions has been observed in helical junction of BWYV pseudoknot (35,36), the modulation of helical junction configuration by the additional S3 in SARS CoV pseudoknot could also play an important role here. Furthermore, the existence of single-strand cutter cleavage for residues connecting S2 and S3 in probing data also suggests a dynamic nature of the junction region. Therefore, reduced frameshift efficiency in mutants potentially disrupting partial or all of the base pair in S3 can thus be caused by changes in junction geometry with the weakening or diminishing of S3 in these mutants.
The significant decrease in −1 frameshift efficiency by upstream attenuation signal appears unexpected as the major viral factors characterized to determine frameshift efficiency all involve sequences between the slippery site and the downstream stimulator. Interestingly, recent works on HIV-1 and barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) both reported the involvement of sequences upstream of the slippery site in modulation of overall −1 frameshift efficiency (37,38). However, only short sequences immediately upstream of the slippery site are involved in the case of HIV-1, and the modulation can go either way for enhancement or attenuation without a defined activity (37). In contrast, a conserved hairpin upstream of the slippery site was proposed to slow down the marching ribosome and thus enhance −1 frameshift efficiency in the case of BYDV (38). Recently, mutational study on the nucleotide adjacent to the slippery site of the SARS CoV also reported an increment of −1 frameshift efficiency in vivo (24). Our finding is thus unique in which, it specifies an RNA element of negatively regulatory activity with general application, and suggest that it is an integral part for the −1 frameshift efficiency determinant of SARS CoV although it is separated from the slippery site with an intervenient spacer. Although sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction for both SARS13 222–13 368 and SARS13 318–13 368 RNA with the corresponding regions of other coronavirues reveal no strong consensus, the sequences of SARS13 318–13 368 RNA do conserve among different strains of SARS CoV (data not shown). The existence of such an attenuation signal may provide the virus a regulation point for the tuning of RdRp synthesis in response to environmental changes. In contrast, a change in spacer sequence identity will lead to a fixed frameshift efficiency although it also reduced the efficiency. Furthermore, it may also change the property of the encoded amino acid composition in the N-terminal region of RdRp with dramatic impacts on the activity of RdRp.
With respect to the mechanisms responsible for the function of this negative determinant of −1 frameshifting, the factors known to affect frameshift efficiency should be examined in the future. However, it is less possible that it is mediated by the encoded polypeptide because 14 out of 18 amino acids encoded within SARS13 318–13 368 RNA were changed in the out of frame mutant and no dramatic change in attenuation activity has been observed. In contrast, it is more likely that the attenuation signal can contact with and affect the factors capable of modulating the frameshift efficiency. Indeed, interferences of dynamic interactions/contacts between pseudoknot and the ribosome or auxiliary factors in mutants of BWYV pseudoknot have been proposed to be responsible for observed frameshift efficiency variation comparing with that of its wild-type counterpart (36). However, it is tempting to speculate that the function of this attenuation element may be related to the extra S3 of downstream atypical pseudoknot. However, the fact that the attenuation signal also downregulates −1 frameshifting promoted by other stimulators suggests its function is general. Furthermore, the requirement for an orientation upstream of the slippery site and the stimulator in vitro indicates that function of the attenuation signal is probably not mediated via interactions with the downstream determinants of −1 frameshifting. Further biochemical analysis of the attenuation element will be informative for revealing how it works and providing insight of the mechanism of −1 ribosomal frameshifting.

42. Information theory-based algorithm for in silico prediction of PCR products with whole genomic sequences as templates
PCR technique is widely used in the molecular biology laboratory. The key step to successful PCR is primer design. Usually, software for PCR primer design only gives a subset of candidates, and we must choose the workable primers empirically. With more organisms' genomes sequenced and data freely available, we may predict PCR products with computer programs and evaluate primer candidates against the target organisms' genomic sequence prior to performing the PCR in the laboratory.
The most important thing for PCR product prediction is finding appropriate primer annealing sites on the template. Many attempts have been made to develop computer programs based on different algorithms for this purpose. Such programs include Amplify [1], simPCR [2], PCRAna [3], PUNS, and Virtual PCR [4]. PUNS [5] is a web-based program for PCR prediction, however, it does not deal with degenerate PCR primer. Some algorithms for the selection of probes or DNA oligos are also related to this field, such as longest common factor approach proposed by Rahmann [6], hybridization free energy based method used by Li [7], Kaderali's work [8] based on an extended nearest neighbor model, and Lexa's PRIMEX [9].
In our research, we designed a new algorithm based on information theory. One information source was obtained by converting the primer sequences to numeric vectors of the potential full hydrogen bond numbers, and the second was created as a vector of the actual hydrogen bond numbers formed between the primer and its potential binding site on the template. An information coefficient was computed for determining the similarity between the two information sources as a criterion to locate primer-annealing sites, and predict products. A computer program, SPCR (Simulated PCR), based on this algorithm was developed to predict PCR products, and its performance was evaluated by replicating 4 cases of laboratory PCR experiments in silico, and performing comparisons between the predicting results of our program and VPCR.
The algorithm is based on base digitalization followed by calculation of information coefficient. Information coefficient we used in this research is a formula based on Shannon's information theory. Shannon's information theory was ever used in other research concerned on primer design, e.g. Purohit et al. [10] used entropy measure to identify conserved regions in aligned sequences for primer design.
The first step of this algorithm is to find out appropriate annealing sites from template sequences. Firstly, let the upstream and downstream primer sequences slide along template sequences respectively, one base per step. At each position where 3'-end base of primers match with the base of templates, a DNA fragment can be acquired from template sequences which length is the same as primer length, which we name as Candidates of Annealing Sites (CAS). The primer sequences and CAS fragments are all converted into numeric vectors. We name the numeric vectors of two primer sequences as PU and PD, and fragments of template as TU and TD. They are defined as below.
PU = [p1, p2,..., pm], PD = [p1, p2,..., pn]     (1)
TU = [t1, t2,..., tm], TD = [t1, t2,..., tn]     (2)
Variables m and n are lengths of upstream and downstream primers. The pi and ti are defined as below.


According to equation (1), (2), (3) and (4), we can transform the DNA sequences of primers and CASs into numeric vectors. Then we can perform the next step, computing the information coefficient (I) for each primer-CAS pair. The formula for the calculation of information coefficient (I) is as equation (5).
Only those sites where the similarity is higher than a preset threshold were selected as annealing sites if the last digit in the vector of T was not 0 (a requirement for perfect match at the 3'-end).
The formula for information coefficient (I) calculation is as follows:

Here 
The value field of information coefficient (I) is (0,1], when primer sequence match with template completely, i.e. P = T, I = 1, and the higher the affinity between primer and template, the greater the value of information coefficient. Information coefficients formed by upstream primer and CAS of template are represented as a set Iup; and accordingly, information coefficients of downstream primer and CAS are Idn.
For each probable product, a successful amplification was determined by 5 parameters: upstream information coefficient Iup, downstream information coefficient Idn, estimated limits for product maximum and minimum length, and product amplification coefficient (Pa) which equals to an average of Iup and Idn. There are two kinds of average methods provided in SPCR program, the arithmetic average, i.e. (Iup+Idn)/2, and the geometric average, (Iup*Idn). We discuss only the geometric average here. Although the two method of average are different in computation, the values are close, and will not change the result of prediction significantly. If, and only if, the values of Iup, Idn, and Pa are all greater than the preset thresholds, and the length of predicted product lies in the preset length limit, did SPCR generate a product between upstream and downstream primer annealing sites within the product length range.
SPCR was implemented as a Win32 application and written in C++ language. It comprises an executable program that can be run directly without the need for installation. The user inputs the primer sequences, sets the thresholds, and provides locally one or more template sequence files, and push the button "Start PCR" to begin the prediction. SPCR can recognize degenerate primers encoded with the IUPAC nucleotide codes. Degenerated base are allowed in primer sequences. Template sequences can be available genomic sequence of the target organism, which must be Single- or Multi-FASTA format. The output of SPCR is a text file of a list of all predicted PCR products.
SPCR saves all produced data, including predicted products and all parameters, into a user-specified result file in pure text format. The output file consists of four parts. The first part is a table in which all of predicted products are listed, including their Pa value, product length, template it comes from, direction of amplification, position of beginning and end, Iup and Idn value, and the upstream and downstream primer sequences. The second part is a digit indicating the number of predicted products. The third part is the detailed nucleotide sequence data in FASTA format of all predicted products in the same order as in the table. The last part includes all parameters set before SPCR running. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the aggregate length of all the template sequences. In addition, SPCR provides a function to simulate agarose gel patterns of output data.
To test the performance of the SPCR program, we first used SPCR to simulate the PCR experiments presented in the Virtual PCR (VPCR) paper [4].
The SPCR prediction results for ARR5 and ARR7 genes were identical to the laboratory PCR results, and no unspecific products were produced (Fig. 1). VPCR gave one unspecific product for the ARR7 gene and 8 unspecific products for ARR5. The SPCR prediction for GEN12 and GEN13 families with degenerate primers gave a predicted agarose profile similar to the laboratory results. More than 80% of the predicted products had counterparts in the laboratory PCR results. VPCR predicted only 2 products for each of the gene families and gave more than 8 unspecific products in each case. Although Lexa et al. has released the 2.0 version of VPCR , the predictions of GEN12 and GEN13 are still not as accurate as SPCR.
We used the universal primer pair P0 and P6 [11] to predict 16S rRNA genes from 59 completed bacterial genomes. We correctly located all copies of 16S rRNA genes from 52 of the tested genomes with all threshold parameters at 0.85. Predictions for three strains yielded 1 or 2 unspecific products, which were eliminated when the threshold parameters were increased to 0.86 or 0.9. Discrepancies between SPCR prediction and GenBank data for three strains were found to be a result of incorrect annotation of the data. In only one strain was an unspecific product found that was longer than the expected gene copy.
SOX proteins contain a conserved HMG-related DNA binding domain, which shares at least 50% identity with that of SRY. Cremazy [12] designed a pair of highly degenerate primers, which were capable of amplifying a broad spectrum of SOX HMG sequences. We predicted SOX HMG sequences from Homo sapiens genome with the primer pair P5-2 and P3-1 and verified with the BLAST (blastn) program [13] that the top 10 products were all known SOX genes.
Two primer pairs for amplification of conserved regions in polymerase coronavirus genes were used to predict PCR products from 7 complete coronavirus genomes, including SARS-CoV and 14 other coronavirus species. All predictions yielded the expected products from all templates, 453 bp for primer pair IN-2(+)/IN-4(-) [14] and 251 bp for 2 Bp/4Bm [15]. Phylogenetic trees based on the predicted products were in agreement with the current taxonomy of coronaviruses.
Besides above cases, we also tested SPCR with successful prediction of primer pairs for genome-specific amplification of environmental bacteria. Unspecific PCR primers against bacterial genomes for random amplification of bacterial community samples also yielded satisfactory results.
The threshold value of 3 parameters Iup, Idn and Pa are selected empirically. Increase of the parameter values can lead to reduction of unspecific products. This corresponds to increase of annealing temperature for reducing unspecific products in actual PCR. Usually, the 3 parameters should be greater than 0.8, if a specific PCR is predicted. If parameters higher than 9.0 still give unspecific products we suggest change of primer pairs if specificity is a major concern.
Amplification of non-targeted products is a common problem in PCR experiments, especially when using complex templates, such as whole genomic DNA or mixtures of genomes. It has been suggested that mismatch tolerance during primer annealing to template is the most important reason for unspecific PCR products, followed by primer length, template size, and product size limits [2]. The current PCR prediction methods are mainly based on probabilistic theories for similarity analysis between primer and template, while some other methods are also used in this field, such as statistical thermodynamics [16] and string comparisons.
A successful computer program for PCR product prediction should be able to identify all potential annealing sites. Sequence similarity between primer and template is the primary factor for selecting annealing sites. In this work we developed a new algorithm to assess the similarity between primer and template after the base sequences were converted into vectors of hydrogen bond numbers. We consider annealing of primer to template a means of information transfer. The hydrogen bond number vector for the primer is the source information, while the vector for template is the target information. The difference between the two information sources is a reflection of the fidelity of this information transfer process. Since hydrogen bonds are formed as a result of specific base recognition between the two DNA strands and the total number of hydrogen bonds is also a major force holding the two strands together, the similarity between these two information sources may be a good estimate of the probability of both annealing site selection and annealed structure stability. The information coefficient calculated in this work is a measure of similarity between two information sources. The value varies between 0–1, reflecting complete difference to 100% identity. In the SPCR program, the threshold can be increased to reduce expected products, which is comparable to increasing annealing temperature to reduce unspecific products in laboratory PCR. In contrast to BLAST, this algorithm tolerates any type of mismatch between primer and template. The successful prediction of all copies of 16S rRNA genes in complete genomes demonstrates the potential of using this algorithm for gene prediction of newly sequenced genomes.
In our evaluating cases, the SPCR program is reasonably good for predicting all potential PCR products with complex templates. This can help the user choose the primer pair that gives the least possible non-targeted products. However, the prediction for random PCR products with SPCR is not satisfactory. When the template is too big, as the case with the human genome, the running time can reach 48 hours.
In current version, SPCR do not consider the situation of insertions and deletions of template sequences, these situations should be considered in future versions. Some refinements for the algorithm can also be done in future, for example, considering the effect of base stacking and alternative penalty for mispairs may improve the accuracy of prediction.

43. Genetic lesions within the 3a gene of SARS-CoV
Numerous isolates of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been completely sequenced [1-4]. In most cases, only synonymous or non-synonymous substitutions have been reported within the major viral genes, which include replicase 1a/1b gene products, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope [1-4]. On the other hand, large insertions or deletions have been found in the part of viral genome that encodes the SARS-CoV accessory proteins which have no viral homologues. The ORF 8a/8b region appears to be particularly prone to mutations as deletions of up to 415 bp have been observed in some isolates [2]. Although these mutations do not appear to have any adverse effect on the survival of the virus, it is conceivable that these mutations may have effects on viral pathogenesis in vivo, as have been observed for other coronaviruses [5].
We have previously reported that a frameshift mutation occurs within the 3a gene of culture-derived SARS-CoV, which results in a protein with a distinctively shorter N-terminus than the wild-type form [6]. Protein 3a is one of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins and the expression of the 3a protein has been demonstrated during both in vitro and in vivo infection [5]. To determine if the mutation arises from repeated passages of the virus or if the mutation exists in the virus that is replicating in SARS-CoV infected patients, we analyzed viral RNA isolated directly from 8 clinical samples and determined the sequence of the 3a gene. Interestingly, we have found evidence of a heterogeneous population of subgenomic RNA 3 (sgRNA3) transcripts in patients with acute SARS-CoV infection containing copies of wild-type and mutant 3a genes.
Total RNA was extracted from 8 patients confirmed with SARS-CoV infection, as defined by WHO guidelines. The use of clinical samples for this study was approved by the Tan Tock Seng Hospital ethics committee. Reverse transcription (RT, Superscript II RT, Invitrogen) was performed on all samples, according to the manufacturer's protocol, and was followed up by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR conditions and subsequent cloning steps have been described elsewhere [6]. Essentially, 15 independent clones from each of the eight SARS patient samples were sequenced. As a polymerase fidelity control of the RT and PCR system, full-length 3a RNA was in vitro transcribed from pXJ40-3a, a cDNA construct for expressing 3a in mammalian cells [6], and subjected to an identical follow-up PCR and cloning protocol.
For the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and Western blot analysis, Vero E6 cells were transiently transfected with pXJmyc-GST, pXJmyc-3a or pXJmyc-3amut1 as previously described (3a and 3amut1 are also known as U274 and U274mut1, respectively, in ref. 6). All these constructs were tagged with the c-myc epitope at the N-terminus. All these experiments were performed as previously described [6].
We have previously identified an oligo(T) tract within the 3a gene, located 16 bp after the first ATG initiation codon, which is prone to insertional mutations [6]. According to several analyses of about 100 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV isolates (in total) obtained from human and animal populations and that have been deposited with Genbank, there has been no report of mutations in this region [1-4]]. It is possible that direct sequencing results do not show this mutation if it is present in only a minority population. There was a previous report on a frameshift mutation in the 3a gene but the identity of this isolate was not mentioned [7]. The 3a gene from culture-derived SARS-CoV isolates contained heterogeneous extensions at this internal oligo(T) tract. The nature of this extension was such that up to three additional T's were added to the 6T's tract. Any change in the number of T's in this oligo(T) tract, other than in multiples of three, would result in a frameshift mutation and premature translation termination of 3a.
We analyzed this region of the 3a gene from eight patients confirmed with SARS-CoV infection and have detected the presence of sgRNA3 transcripts, carrying 6T's to 10T's tract, in these patients (Figure 1). As our polymerase fidelity controls have confirmed that it is highly unlikely that sequencing and PCR errors are the source of these nucleotide aberrations (data not shown), and these results showed that different variants of the 3a gene exist in the viruses that were replicating in these patients. The percentage of the different mutant transcripts varied considerably from patient to patient. However, in 6 out of the 8 patients, more than 50 % of the sgRNA3 transcripts contains either 6T's or 9T's, which means that the full-length 3a (or with 1 additional amino acid) will be expressed. In patient D, less than 10 % of the transcripts are in-frame, while in patient E, none of the transcripts is in-frame, indicating that the full-length 3a protein will be expressed at a low level (Pat D) or not expressed at all (Pat E). In comparison, about 27 % of the transcripts from a culture-derived virus are in-frame [6]. Overall, these results showed that the frameshift mutations of the 3a gene are not specific to culture-derived SARS-CoV and that they point towards the existence of quasispecies within a given population of SARS-CoVs. As deduced from their study of sequence variation of the spike gene from viral isolates, another group has also suggested that SARS-CoV quasispecies exists in vivo [8].
Translation of a frameshifted 3a gene would terminate shortly after 18 residues or so. Nonetheless, there are two alternative initiation codons located downstream. Translation from these would result in two possible smaller 3a gene products. We have shown that at least one of these truncated forms of 3a, named as 3amut1, can be detected in the lysate of infected cells [6]. It has been shown that the 3a is localized to the cell surface of SARS-CoV infected cells [6,9]. FACS analysis showed that while the myc-3a protein (full-length 3a with a c-myc epitope at the N-terminus) was transported to the cell surface in transiently transfected Vero E6 cells, the myc-3amut1 (truncated 3a with the same c-myc epitope) could not be detected on cell surface (Figure 2A). Western blot analysis was also performed to ensure that the expressions of the full-length and truncated 3a proteins in the transfected cells were comparable (Figure 2B). As 3amut1 corresponds to 101 to 274 amino acids of 3a and lacks the first two transmembrane domains [6], our results showed that these two transmembrane domains are essential for the expression of 3a on the cell surface.
It is possible that the aberrant nature of the oligo(T) tract in the 3a gene is akin to that of the nucleotide insertion event in the oligo(A) tract of the 3b gene of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), another coronavirus [10]. The insertion of a single adenylate nucleotide into this region of 3b resulted in a C-terminally truncated gene product. The corresponding mutant 3b was also localized differently within the cell. In view of the fact that 3a has also been shown to interact with the spike protein [6,7] and that both proteins have a tendency to co-mutate [7], it would be interesting to know whether these serial frameshift mutations can also be correlated with a recognizable mutation pattern of the spike gene.
In other RNA viruses, such as the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and human respiratory syncytial virus, internal poly(A) extensions have been identified before as a hot spot for mutations [11,12]. Similarly, these extensions also create frameshift mutations in the affected genes. FMDV populations with longer poly(A) extensions seem to have a lower fitness value as compared to those with shorter extensions [11]. This is despite the fact that both the wild-type and mutant forms of the affected FMDV protein, the L protease, have equal functionality [13]. In addition, viral genomes possessing different lengths of the poly(A) tract could be recognized even from just a single PFU of FMDV [11].
It is intriguing to find that unlike 3a, the 3amut1 is not transported to the cell surface as the cell surface expression (and endocytotic properties) of 3a may be involved in modulating the trafficking properties of the spike protein [14]. Our results showed that the viruses in some of the patients appear to encode only for the truncated form(s) of 3a and not the full-length 3a protein (Figure 1) and indicated that the functionality of full-length 3a is not essential for virus replication. However, it is also conceivable that the different variants of 3a have different stabilities and/or functions, and hence would contribute differently to viral pathogenesis in vivo. In addition, it was recently reported that 3a is a structural protein and at least 2 truncated forms of 3a were dominantly present in the virion [9]. Further studies will reveal if the truncated forms of 3a, which results from frameshift mutations in the viral genome, can be incorporated in the virion and if there are phenotypic effects of a truncated 3a during the infection cycle. With respect to viral viability in the natural host, does full-length 3a confer a fitness gain over truncated 3a? If so, the possibility remains that under selective pressure, the distribution of viral genotypes could tip in favor to those which carry the wild-type 3a gene. A similar genotypic reversion event has been documented for FMDV [11]. Further studies on a larger cohort of patients will be necessary to establish if there is a relationship between the mutations observed in the 3a transcripts and the severity of the clinical symptoms in individual patients.
