All amino acids at the anchor positions other than the permissible ones were assigned low scores to exclude peptides with non-permissible amino acids from the list of predicted binders. The final binding scores were normalized to a scale of 1–9 and the final models were tested and validated rigorously.

All amimo acids at the anchor positions other than the permissible ones were assigned low scores to exclude petides with non-permisible amimo acids from the list of predicted binders. The final binding scores were normalised to a scale of 1–9 and the final models were tested and validated rigorous.

Ori:
It was assumed that two test sequences could be distinguished if one of them contained a sub-sequence and the other did not, even if the second contained a sub-sequence that differed from one in the first at only one position, as hybridisation methods to distinguish such sequences are well established for the assay of single nucleotide polymorphisms

One advantage of combining region-specific amplification with identification using combinatorial probes is that related but previously unrecognised or uncharacterised species or subtypes may be found.
